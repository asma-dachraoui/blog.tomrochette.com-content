## Introduction
* The prefrontal cortex is the neocortical region that is most elaborated in primates, animals known for their diverse and flexible behavioral repertoire

### The Role of the PFC in Top-Down Control of Behavior
* The PFC is not critical for performing simple, automatic behaviors, such as our tendency to automatically orient to an unexpected sound or movement
* The PFC is critical in situations when the mappings between sensory inputs, thoughts, and actions either are weakly established relative to other existing ones or are rapidly changing
* Two classic tasks illustrate this point: the Stroop task and the Wisconsin card sort task
	* In the Stroop task, subjects either read words or name the color in which they are written
	* In WCST, subjects are instructed to sort cards according to shape, color, or number of symbols appearing on them and the sorting rule varies periodically
* In this article, we argue that all these functions (selective attention, behavioral inhibition, working memory, rule-based or goal-directed behavior) depend on the representation of goals and rules in the form of patterns of activity in the PFC, which configure processing in other parts of the brain in accordance with current task demands
* We build on the fundamental principle that processing in the brain is competitive: Different pathways, carrying different sources of information, compete for expression in behavior, and the winners are those with the strongest sources of support

### Overview of the Theory
* We assume that the PFC serves a specific function in cognitive control: the active maintenance of patterns of activity that represent goals and the means to achieve them
* The aggregate effect of the bias signals (provided by the PFC) is to guide the flow of neural activity along pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task

### Minimal Requirements for a Mechanism of Top-Down Control
* The PFC must provide a source of activity that can exert the required pattern of biasing signals to other structures
* The PFC must maintain its activity robustly against distractions until a goal is achieved, yet also be flexible enough to update its representations when needed
* It must house the appropriate representations, those that can select the neural pathways needed for the task
* PFC representations must have a high capacity for multimodality and integration
* The PFC must exhibit a high degree of plasticity

## Properties of the PFC
### Convergence of Diverse Information
* One of the critical features for a system of cognitive control is the requirement that it have access to diverse information about both the internal state of the system and the external state of the world

### Convergence and Plasticity
* Given that goal-directed behavior depends on our ability to piece together relationships between a wide range of external and internal information, it stands to reason that top-down control must come from PFC representations that reflect a wide range of learned associations
* Petrides found that following PFC damage, patients could no longer learn arbitrary associations between visual patterns and hand gestures
* In monkeys, damage to ventrolateral area 12 or to the arcuate sulcus region also impairs the ability to learn arbitrary cue-response associations
* Learning of visual stimuli-response conditional associations is also impaired by damage to the PFC from the temporal cortex
* Passingham argues that most, if not all, tasks that are disrupted following PFC damage depend on acquiring conditional associations (if-then rules)
* In sum, these results indicate that PFC neural activity represents the rules, or mappings required to perform a particular task, and not just single stimuli or forthcoming actions
* We assume that this activity within the PFC establishes these mappings by biasing competition in other parts of the brain responsible for actually performing the task
* These signals favor task-relevant sensory inputs (attention), memories (recall), and motor outputs (response selection) and thus guide activity along the pathways that connect them (conditional associations)
