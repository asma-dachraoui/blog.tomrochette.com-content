## Arrival of new data

1. The data is taken as a single unit. An **Identifier** is produced to uniquely identify it.
2. An **OrderedSet** is produced. It is uniquely identified by the **Identifier** that was just produced.
3. The data received is stored in a single **Chunk**. That **Chunk** is pointed to by the **OrderedSet** that was produced in step 2.

## Arrival of new data with existing and overlapping data
