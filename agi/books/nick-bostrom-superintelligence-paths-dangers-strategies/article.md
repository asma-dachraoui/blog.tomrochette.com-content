## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How would a superintelligence be different than human society?
	* In itself, a society or a company is a sublinear arrangement of human minds (that is, the addition of new people to the group scales sublinearly)
* Bostrom uses the term "make the detonation survivable", which reminds me of the development of the atomic bomb. How different would intelligence explosion be from the development of the atomic bomb?
* Given infinite computing power, how would one be able to detect/recognize intelligent behavior from programs (out of all the randomly generated programs)?
* Is it possible to define some sort of "unit of intellectual work"?

# Overview

# Notes
* In regular font are notes/excerpts from the book
* In italic font are my comments

## Preface
* The control problem: the problem of how to control what the superintelligence would do
* *Creating a superintelligence seems to imply to the author that we can only create one and not many, as we are many human individuals*
	* *Maybe it has to do with the idea of superintelligence hierarchies, where a superintelligence will dominate all others*

## Chapter 1 - Past developments and present capabilities
### Seasons of hope and despair
* To overcome the combinatorial explosion, one needs algorithms that exploit structure in the target domain and take advantage of prior knowledge by using heuristic search, planning, and flexible abstract representations

### State of the art
* AI-complete: the difficulty of solving these problems is essentially equivalent to the difficulty of building generally human-level intelligent machines. In other words, if somebody were to succeed in creating an AI that could understand natural language as well as a human adult, they would in all likelihood also either already have succeeded in creating an AI that could do everything else that a human intelligence can do, or they would be but a very short step from such a general capability

## Chapter 2 - Paths to superintelligence
* We can tentatively define a superintelligence as any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest

### Artificial intelligence
* We can discern some general features of the kind of system that would be required
* It now seems clear that a capacity to learn would be an integral feature of the core design of a system intended to attain general intelligence
* The same holds for the ability to deal effectively with uncertainty and probabilistic information
* Some faculty for extracting useful concepts from sensory data and internal states, and for leveraging acquired concepts into flexible combinatorial representations for use in logical and intuitive reasoning
* Another way of arguing for the feasibility of artificial intelligence is by pointing to the human brain and suggesting that we could use it as a template for a machine intelligence
* One can distinguish different versions of this approach based on how closely they propose to imitate biological brain functions
	* At one extreme - that of very close imitation - we have the idea of whole brain emulation
	* At the other extreme are approaches that take their inspiration from the functioning of the brain but do not attempt low-level imitation
* Since there is a limited number - perhaps a very small number - of distinct fundamental mechanisms that operate in the brain, continuing incremental progress in brain science should eventually discover them all
* An artificial intelligence need not much resemble a human mind. AIs could be - indeed, it is likely that most will be - extremely alien
* We should expect that they will have very different cognitive architectures than biological intelligences, and in their early stages of development they will have very different profiles of cognitive strengths and weaknesses

### Whole brain emulation
* In whole brain emulation (also known as "uploading"), intelligent software would be produced by scanning and closely modeling the computational structure of a biological brain
* Achieving whole brain emulation requires the accomplishment of the following steps
	* A sufficiently detailed scan of a particular human brain is created
	* The raw data from the scanners is fed to a computer for automated image processing to reconstruct the three-dimensional neuronal network that implemented cognition in the original brain
	* The neurocomputational structure resulting from the previous step is implemented on a sufficiently powerful computer
* The whole brain emulation path does not require that we figure out how human cognition works or how to program an artificial intelligence
* It requires only that we understand the low-level functional characteristics of the basic computational elements of the brain
* Whole brain emulation does require some rather advanced enabling technologies. There are three key prerequisites:
	* Scanning: high-throughput microscopy with sufficient resolution and detection of relevant properties
	* Translation: automated image analysis to turn raw scanning data into an interpreted three-dimensional model of relevant neurocomputational elements
	* Simulation: hardware powerful enough to implement the resultant computational structure
* The aim is not to create a brain simulation so detailed and accurate that one could use it to predict exactly what would have happened in the original brain if it had been subjected to a particular sequence of stimuli. Instead, the aim is to capture enough of the computationally functional properties of the brain to enable the resultant emulation to perform intellectual work
* Knowing merely which neurons are connected with which is not enough. TO create a brain emulation one would also need to know which synapses are excitatory and which are inhibitory; the strength of the connections; and various dynamical properties of the axons, synapses, and dendritic trees

### Biological cognition
* A third path to greater-than-current-human intelligence is to enhance the function of biological brains
* In principle, this could be achieved without technology, through selective breeding
* It seems implausible, on both neurological and evolutionary grounds, that one could by introducing some chemical into the brain of a healthy person spark a dramatic rise in intelligence
* Manipulation of genetics will provide a more powerful set of tools than psychopharmacology
* The problem with sequential selection, of course, is that it takes longer. If each generational step takes twenty or thirty years, then even just five successful generations would push us well into the twenty-second century
* One intervention that becomes possible when human genomes can be synthesized is genetic "spell-checking" of an embryo
* Each of us currently carries a mutational load, with perhaps hundreds of mutations that reduce the efficiency of various cellular processes
* With gene synthesis we could take the genome of an embryo and construct a version of that genome free from the genetic noise of accumulated mutations
* Three conclusions
	* at least weak forms of superintelligence are achievable by means of biotechnological enhancements
	* the feasibility of cognitively enhanced humans adds to the plausibility that advanced forms of machine intelligence are feasible
	* when we consider scenarios stretching significantly into the second half of this century and beyond, we must take into account the probable emergence of a generation of genetically enhanced populations, with the magnitude of enhancement escalating rapidly over subsequent decades

### Brain-computer interfaces
* Although the possibility of direct connections between humans brains and computers has been demonstrated, it seems unlikely that such interfaces will be widely used as enhancements any time soon
* To begin with, there are significant risks of medical complications -  infections, electrode displacement, hemorrhage, and cognitive decline - when implanting electrodes in the brain
* The second reason to doubt superintelligence will be achieved through cyborgization is that enhancement is likely to be far more difficult than therapy
* Even if there were an easy way of pumping more information into our brains, the extra data inflow would do little to increase the rate at which we think and learn unless all the neural machinery necessary for making sense of the data were similarly upgraded
