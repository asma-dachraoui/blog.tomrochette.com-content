## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How would a superintelligence be different than human society?
	* In itself, a society or a company is a sublinear arrangement of human minds (that is, the addition of new people to the group scales sublinearly)
* Bostrom uses the term "make the detonation survivable", which reminds me of the development of the atomic bomb. How different would intelligence explosion be from the development of the atomic bomb?
* Given infinite computing power, how would one be able to detect/recognize intelligent behavior from programs (out of all the randomly generated programs)?
* Is it possible to define some sort of "unit of intellectual work"?
* Should we expect generalists+specialists collective systems to outperform generalists only (monolithic) systems?
* What type of invention, similar to the print press, electricity or the Internet would lead to an intellectual revolution?

# Overview

# Notes
* In regular font are notes/excerpts from the book
* In italic font are my comments

## Preface
* The control problem: the problem of how to control what the superintelligence would do
* *Creating a superintelligence seems to imply to the author that we can only create one and not many, as we are many human individuals*
	* *Maybe it has to do with the idea of superintelligence hierarchies, where a superintelligence will dominate all others*

## Chapter 1 - Past developments and present capabilities
### Seasons of hope and despair
* To overcome the combinatorial explosion, one needs algorithms that exploit structure in the target domain and take advantage of prior knowledge by using heuristic search, planning, and flexible abstract representations

### State of the art
* AI-complete: the difficulty of solving these problems is essentially equivalent to the difficulty of building generally human-level intelligent machines. In other words, if somebody were to succeed in creating an AI that could understand natural language as well as a human adult, they would in all likelihood also either already have succeeded in creating an AI that could do everything else that a human intelligence can do, or they would be but a very short step from such a general capability

## Chapter 2 - Paths to superintelligence
* We can tentatively define a superintelligence as any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest

### Artificial intelligence
* We can discern some general features of the kind of system that would be required
* It now seems clear that a capacity to learn would be an integral feature of the core design of a system intended to attain general intelligence
* The same holds for the ability to deal effectively with uncertainty and probabilistic information
* Some faculty for extracting useful concepts from sensory data and internal states, and for leveraging acquired concepts into flexible combinatorial representations for use in logical and intuitive reasoning
* Another way of arguing for the feasibility of artificial intelligence is by pointing to the human brain and suggesting that we could use it as a template for a machine intelligence
* One can distinguish different versions of this approach based on how closely they propose to imitate biological brain functions
	* At one extreme - that of very close imitation - we have the idea of whole brain emulation
	* At the other extreme are approaches that take their inspiration from the functioning of the brain but do not attempt low-level imitation
* Since there is a limited number - perhaps a very small number - of distinct fundamental mechanisms that operate in the brain, continuing incremental progress in brain science should eventually discover them all
* An artificial intelligence need not much resemble a human mind. AIs could be - indeed, it is likely that most will be - extremely alien
* We should expect that they will have very different cognitive architectures than biological intelligences, and in their early stages of development they will have very different profiles of cognitive strengths and weaknesses

### Whole brain emulation
* In whole brain emulation (also known as "uploading"), intelligent software would be produced by scanning and closely modeling the computational structure of a biological brain
* Achieving whole brain emulation requires the accomplishment of the following steps
	* A sufficiently detailed scan of a particular human brain is created
	* The raw data from the scanners is fed to a computer for automated image processing to reconstruct the three-dimensional neuronal network that implemented cognition in the original brain
	* The neurocomputational structure resulting from the previous step is implemented on a sufficiently powerful computer
* The whole brain emulation path does not require that we figure out how human cognition works or how to program an artificial intelligence
* It requires only that we understand the low-level functional characteristics of the basic computational elements of the brain
* Whole brain emulation does require some rather advanced enabling technologies. There are three key prerequisites:
	* Scanning: high-throughput microscopy with sufficient resolution and detection of relevant properties
	* Translation: automated image analysis to turn raw scanning data into an interpreted three-dimensional model of relevant neurocomputational elements
	* Simulation: hardware powerful enough to implement the resultant computational structure
* The aim is not to create a brain simulation so detailed and accurate that one could use it to predict exactly what would have happened in the original brain if it had been subjected to a particular sequence of stimuli. Instead, the aim is to capture enough of the computationally functional properties of the brain to enable the resultant emulation to perform intellectual work
* Knowing merely which neurons are connected with which is not enough. TO create a brain emulation one would also need to know which synapses are excitatory and which are inhibitory; the strength of the connections; and various dynamical properties of the axons, synapses, and dendritic trees

### Biological cognition
* A third path to greater-than-current-human intelligence is to enhance the function of biological brains
* In principle, this could be achieved without technology, through selective breeding
* It seems implausible, on both neurological and evolutionary grounds, that one could by introducing some chemical into the brain of a healthy person spark a dramatic rise in intelligence
* Manipulation of genetics will provide a more powerful set of tools than psychopharmacology
* The problem with sequential selection, of course, is that it takes longer. If each generational step takes twenty or thirty years, then even just five successful generations would push us well into the twenty-second century
* One intervention that becomes possible when human genomes can be synthesized is genetic "spell-checking" of an embryo
* Each of us currently carries a mutational load, with perhaps hundreds of mutations that reduce the efficiency of various cellular processes
* With gene synthesis we could take the genome of an embryo and construct a version of that genome free from the genetic noise of accumulated mutations
* Three conclusions
	* at least weak forms of superintelligence are achievable by means of biotechnological enhancements
	* the feasibility of cognitively enhanced humans adds to the plausibility that advanced forms of machine intelligence are feasible
	* when we consider scenarios stretching significantly into the second half of this century and beyond, we must take into account the probable emergence of a generation of genetically enhanced populations, with the magnitude of enhancement escalating rapidly over subsequent decades

### Brain-computer interfaces
* Although the possibility of direct connections between humans brains and computers has been demonstrated, it seems unlikely that such interfaces will be widely used as enhancements any time soon
* To begin with, there are significant risks of medical complications -  infections, electrode displacement, hemorrhage, and cognitive decline - when implanting electrodes in the brain
* The second reason to doubt superintelligence will be achieved through cyborgization is that enhancement is likely to be far more difficult than therapy
* Even if there were an easy way of pumping more information into our brains, the extra data inflow would do little to increase the rate at which we think and learn unless all the neural machinery necessary for making sense of the data were similarly upgraded
* Keeping our machines outside of our bodies also makes upgrading easier
* The rate-limiting step in human intelligence is not how fast raw data can be fed into the brain but rather how quickly the brain can extract meaning and make sense of the data
* Perhaps it will be suggested that we transmit meanings directly, rather than package them into sensory data that must be decoded by the recipient. There are two problems with this
	* Brains, by contrast to the kinds of program we typically run on our computers, do not use standardized data storage and representation formats. Rather, each brain develops its own idiosyncratic representations of higher-level content
	* Creating the required interface (to read/write from billions of individually addressable neurons) is probably an AI-complete problem
* One hope for the cyborg route is that the brain, if permanently implanted with a device connecting it to some external resource, would over time learn an effective mapping between its own internal cognitive states and the inputs it receives from, or the outputs accepted by, the device
	* Then the implant itself would not need to be intelligent; rather, the brain would intelligently adapt to the interface, much as the brain of an infant gradually learns to interpret the signals arriving from receptors in its eyes and ears

### Networks and organizations
* The idea here is not that this would enhance the intellectual capacity of individuals enough to make them superintelligent, but rather that some system composed of individuals thus networked and organized might attain a form of superintelligence
* In general terms, a system's collective intelligence is limited by the abilities of its member minds, the overheads in communicating relevant information between them, and the various distortions and inefficiencies that pervade human organizations
* If communication overheads are reduced (including not only equipment costs but also response latencies, time and attention burdens, and other factors), then larger and more densely connected organizations become feasible
* Could the Internet become something more than just the backbone of a loosely integrated collective superintelligence - something more like a virtual skull housing an emerging unified super-intellect

## Chapter 3 - Forms of superintelligence
* We use the term "superintelligence" to refer to intellects that greatly outperform the best current human minds across many very general cognitive domains
* We will differentiate between three forms:
	* speed superintelligence
	* collective superintelligence
	* quality superintelligence

### Speed superintelligence
* A speed superintelligence is an intellect that is just like a human mind but faster
* Speed superintelligence: A system that can do all that a human intellect can do, but much faster
* An emulation operating at a speed of ten thousand times that of a biological brain would be able to read a book in a few seconds and write a PhD thesis in a afternoon. With a speedup factor of a million, an emulation could accomplish an entire millenium of intellectual work in one working day
* Suppose your mind ran at 10000x
	* Because of this apparent time dilation of the material world, a speed superintelligence would prefer to work with digital objects
	* Alternatively, it could interact with the physical environment by means of nanoscale manipulators, since limbs at such small scales could operate faster than macroscopic appendages
* The speed of light becomes an increasingly important constraint as minds get faster, since faster minds face greater opportunity costs in the use of their time for traveling or communicating over long distances

### Collective superintelligence
* Collective superintelligence: A system composed of a large number of smaller intellects such that the system's overall performance across many very general domains vastly outstrips that of any current cognitive system
* Collective intelligence excels at solving problems that can be readily broken into parts such that solutions to sub-problems can be pursued in parallel and verified independently
* A system's collective intelligence could be enhanced by expanding the number or the quality of its constituent intellects, or by improving the quality of their organization
* The definition does not even imply that the more collectively intelligent society is wiser
* We can think of wisdom as the ability to get the important things approximately right
* We should recognize that there can exist instrumentally powerful information processing systems - intelligent systems - that are neither inherently good nor reliably wise
* A collective superintelligence could, after gaining sufficiently in integration, become a "quality superintelligence"

### Quality superintelligence
* Quality superintelligence: A system that is at least as fast as a human mind and vastly qualitatively smarter
* We can expand the range of our reference points by considering nonhuman animals, which have intelligence of lower quality
* Nonhuman animals lack complex structured language; they are capable of no or only rudimentary tool use and tool construction; they are severely restricted in their ability to make long-term plans; and they have very limited abstract reasoning ability
* The concept of quality superintelligence: it is intelligence of quality at least as superior to that of human intelligence as the quality of human intelligence is superior to that of elephants', dolphins', or chimpanzees'
* A second way to illustrate the concept of quality superintelligence is by noting the domain-specific cognitive deficits that can afflict individual humans, particularly deficits that are not caused by general dementia or other conditions associated with wholesale destruction of the brain's neurocomputational resources
* Such examples show that normal human adults have a raneg of remarkable cognitive talents that are not simply a function of possessing a sufficient amount of general neural processing power or even a sufficient amount of general intelligence: specialized neural circuitry is also needed

### Direct and indirect reach
* We might say that speed superintelligence excels at tasks requiring the rapid execution of a long series of steps that must be performed sequentially while collective superintelligence excels at tasks admitting of analytic decomposition into parallelizable sub-tasks and tasks demanding the combination of many different perspectives and skill sets
* In some domains, quantity is a poor substitute for quality
* If we widen our purview to include superintelligent minds, we must countenance a likelihood of there being intellectual problems solvable only by superintelligence and intractiable to any ever-so-large collective of non-augmented humans
* We cannot clearly see what all these problems are, but we can characterize them in general terms. They would tend to be problems involving multiple complex interdependencies that do not permit of independently verifiable solution steps: problems that therefore cannot be in piecemeal fashion, and that might require qualitatively new kinds of understanding or new representational frameworks that are too deep or too complicated for the current edition of mortals to discover or use effectively

### Sources of advantage for digital intelligence
* Hardware advantages
	* Speed of computational elements
	* Internal communication speed
	* Number of computational elements
	* Storage capacity
	* Reliability, lifespan, sensors, etc.
* Software advantages
	* Editability
	* Duplicability
	* Goal coordination
	* Memory sharing
	* New modules, modalities, and algorithms

## Chapter 4 - The kinetics of an intelligence explosion
### Timing and speed of the takeoff
* If and when such machine is developed, how long will it be from then until a machine becomes radically superintelligent?
* We can distinguish three classes of transition scenarios, based on their steepness
	* Slow: A slow takeoff is one that occurs over some long temporal interval, such as decades or centuries
	* Fast: A fast takeoff occurs over some short temporal interval, such as minutes, hours, or days
	* Moderate: A moderate takeoff is one that occurs over some intermediary temporal interval, such as months or years
* We can conceive the rate of increase in a system's intelligence as a (monotonically increasing) function of two variables: the amount of "optimization power" , or quality-weighted design effort, that is being applied to increase the system's intelligence, and the responsiveness of the system to the application of a given amount of such optimization power
$$
\text{Rate of change in intelligence} = \frac{\text{Optimization power}}{\text{Recalcitrance}}
$$
* A system's recalcitrance might also vary depending on how much the system has already been optimized
	* Often, the easiest improvements are made first, leading to diminishing returns as low-hanging fruits are depleted

### Recalcitrance
#### Emulation and AI paths
* The path toward artificial intelligence may feature no obvious milestone or early observation point. It is entirely possible that the quest for artificial intelligence will appear to be lost in dense jungle until an unexpected breakthrough reveals the finishing line in a clearing just a few short steps away
* It is quite possible that recalcitrance falls when a machine reaches human parity
* Suppose an AI is composed of two subsystems, one possessing domain-specific problem-solving techniques, the other possessing general-purpose reasoning ability. It could be the case that while the second subsystem remains below a certain capacity threshold, it contributes nothing to the system's overall performance, because the solutions it generates are always inferior to those generated by the domain-specific subsystem. Suppose now that a small amount of optimization power is applied to the general-purpose subsystem and that this produces a brisk rise in the capacity of that subsystem. At first, we observe no increase in the overall system's performance, indicating that recalcitrance is high. Then, once the capacity of the general-purpose subsystem crosses the threshold where its solutions start to beat those of the domain-specific subsystem, the overall system's performance suddenly beings to improve at the same brisk pace as the general-purpose subsystem, even as the amount of optimization power applied stays constant: the system's recalcitrance has plummeted
* It is also possible that our natural tendency to view intelligence from an anthropocentric perspective will lead us to underestimate improvements in sub-human systems, and thus to overestimate recalcitrance
* A system's intellectual problem-solving capacity can be enhanced not only by making the system cleverer but also by expanding what the system knows
* In order to tap the full potential of fast content accumulation, however, a system needs to have a correspondingly large memory capacity. There is little point in reading an entire library if you have forgotten all about the aardvark by the time you get to the abalone
