## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How would a superintelligence be different than human society?
	* In itself, a society or a company is a sublinear arrangement of human minds (that is, the addition of new people to the group scales sublinearly)
* Bostrom uses the term "make the detonation survivable", which reminds me of the development of the atomic bomb. How different would intelligence explosion be from the development of the atomic bomb?

# Overview

# Notes
* In regular font are notes/excerpts from the book
* In italic font are my comments

## Preface
* The control problem: the problem of how to control what the superintelligence would do
* *Creating a superintelligence seems to imply to the author that we can only create one and not many, as we are many human individuals*
	* *Maybe it has to do with the idea of superintelligence hierarchies, where a superintelligence will dominate all others*

## Chapter 1 - Past developments and present capabilities
### Seasons of hope and despair
* To overcome the combinatorial explosion, one needs algorithms that exploit structure in the target domain and take advantage of prior knowledge by using heuristic search, planning, and flexible abstract representations

### State of the art
* AI-complete: the difficulty of solving these problems is essentially equivalent to the difficulty of building generally human-level intelligent machines. In other words, if somebody were to succeed in creating an AI that could understand natural language as well as a human adult, they would in all likelihood also either already have succeeded in creating an AI that could do everything else that a human intelligence can do, or they would be but a very short step from such a general capability

## Chapter 2 - Paths to superintelligence
* We can tentatively define a superintelligence as any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest
