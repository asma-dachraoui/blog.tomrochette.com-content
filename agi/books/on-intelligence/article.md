# Overview

# Notes
## Preface
* The biggest mistake is the belief that intelligence is defined by intelligent behavior
* It is the ability to make predictions about the future that is the crux of intelligence
* A good theory should be easy to comprehend, not obscured in jargon or convoluted argument

## 1 Artificial Intelligence
* Computers and brains are built on completely different principles
	* One is programmed, one is self-learning
	* One has to be perfect to work at all, one is naturally flexible and tolerant of failures
	* One has a central processor, one has no centralized control
* The AI approach was born with the digital computer
* A key figure in the early AI movement was the English mathematician Alan Turing
* A thesis of this book is that understanding cannot be measured by external behavior, it is instead an internal metric of how the brain remembers things and uses its memories to make predictions
* When you don't know how to proceed, often the best strategy is to make no changes until your options become clear

# 2 Neural Networks
* Linguists talked of intelligence in terms such as "syntax" and "semantics". To them, the brain and intelligence was all about language
* Vision scientists referred to 2D, 2.5D and 3D sketches. To them, the brain and intelligence was all about visual pattern recognition
* Computer scientists talked of schemas and frames, new terms they made up to represent knowledge
* Anatomists and neurophysiologists wrote extensively about the structure of the brain and how neurons behave, but they mostly avoided any attempt at large-scale theory
* A neural network is unlike a computer in that it has no CPU and doesn't store information in a centralized memory. The network's knowledge and memories are distributed throughout its connectivity - just like real brains (the connectivities/weight values is the distributed memory, which, unless "stored"/"persisted", means that the brain would be void of any memory)
* Hawkins 3 essential things to understanding the brain:
	* The inclusion of time in brain function: Real brains process rapidly changing streams of information. There is nothing static about the flow of information into and out of the brain.
	* The importance of feedback: Feedback dominates most connections throughout the neocortex.
	* Any theory or model of the brain should account for the physical architecture of the brain: Any neural network that didn't acknowledge ... the repeating hierarchical structure of the neocortex ... was certainly not going to work like a brain.
* The most fundamental problem with most neural networks is a trait they share with AI programs. Both are fatally burdened by their focus on behavior. Whether they are calling these behaviors "answers," "patterns," or "outputs," both AI and neural networks assume intelligence lies in the behavior that a program or a neural network produces after processing a given input. The most important attribute of a computer program or a neural network is whether it gives the correct or desired output. As inspired by Alan Turing, intelligence equals behavior
* Intelligence is not just a matter of acting or behaving intelligently. Behavior is a manifestation of intelligence, but not the central characteristic or primary definition of being intelligent
* You can be intelligent just lying in the dark, thinking and understanding
* Auto-associative memories are built out of simple "neurons" that connected to each other and fired when they reached a certain threshold. They are interconnected differently than regular neural networks, using lots of feedback. Instead of only passing information forward, as in a back propagation network, auto-associative memories fed the output of each neuron back into the input. This feedback loop led to some interesting features. When a pattern of activity was imposed on the artificial neurons, they formed a memory of this pattern
* The most important property is that you don't have to have the entire pattern you want to retrieve in order to retrieve it
* An auto-associative memory can be designed to store sequences of patterns, or temporal patterns
* Hawkins proposes the brain uses circuits similar to auto-associative memory
* We don't have machine that think, we have machines that do
* Intelligence is something that is happening in your head. Behavior is an optional ingredient
* According to functionalism, being intelligent or having a mind is purely a property of organization and has nothing to do with what you're organized out of
* By this principle, an artificial system that used the same functional architecture as an intelligent, living brain should be likewise intelligent - and not just contrivedly so, but actually, truly intelligent
* Some philosophers of mind have taken a shine to the metaphor of the "cognitive wheel," that is, an AI solution to some problem that although entirely different from how the brain does it is just as good
* To succeed (have intelligent machines), we will need to crib heavily from nature's engine of intelligence, the neocortex. We have to extract intelligence from within the brain

## 3 The Human Brain
* Being human and being intelligent are separate matters. An intelligent machine need not have sexual urges, hunger, a pulse, muscles, emotions, or a humanlike body
* The neocortex is about 2 millimeters thick and has six layers
* Stretched flat, the human neocortical sheet is roughly the size of a large dinner napkin
* Human are smarter because our cortex, relative to body size, covers a larger area, not because our layers are thicker or contain some special class of "smart" cells
* Some anatomists have estimated that the typical human neocortex contains around thirty billion neurons (30,000,000,000), but no one would be surprised if the figure was significantly higer or lower
* Each of these regions (of the cortex) is semi-independent and seems to be specialized for certain aspects of perception or thought. Physically they are arranged in an irregular patchwork quilt, which varies only a little from person to person. Rarely are the functions cleanly delineated. Functionally they are arranged in a branching hierarchy
* The lowest of the functional regions, the primary sensory areas, are where sensory information first arrives in the cortex
* V1 (the primary visual area) is concerned with low-level visual features such as tiny edge-segments, small-scale components of motion, binocular disparity (for stereo-vision), and basic color and constrast information
* Eventually, sensory information passes into "association areas," which is the name sometimes used for the regions of the cortex that receive inputs from more than one sense
* It is thanks to association regions that your are able to be aware that the sight of a fly crawling up your arm and the tickling sensation you feel there share the same cause
