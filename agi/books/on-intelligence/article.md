# Overview

# Notes
## Preface
* The biggest mistake is the belief that intelligence is defined by intelligent behavior
* It is the ability to make predictions about the future that is the crux of intelligence
* A good theory should be easy to comprehend, not obscured in jargon or convoluted argument

## 1 Artificial Intelligence
* Computers and brains are built on completely different principles
	* One is programmed, one is self-learning
	* One has to be perfect to work at all, one is naturally flexible and tolerant of failures
	* One has a central processor, one has no centralized control
* The AI approach was born with the digital computer
* A key figure in the early AI movement was the English mathematician Alan Turing
* A thesis of this book is that understanding cannot be measured by external behavior, it is instead an internal metric of how the brain remembers things and uses its memories to make predictions
* When you don't know how to proceed, often the best strategy is to make no changes until your options become clear
