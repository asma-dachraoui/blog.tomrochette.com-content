## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How to speed up note taking?
* A notebook system where things gradually fade away, as a way to force you to reconsider them
* Is it worth doing? Taking the time to do so has an opportunity cost
* Where should things go? Is there an easy way to determine where something should go?

# Overview

# Notes
## Introduction
* Recording of all my thoughts
* Helps with clarity of mind
* It makes it difficult to think about other positions as it helps to crystallize your thoughts
* The author doesn't know whether this method is useful/valuable yet
* Two types of note keeping:
	* The diary
	* The category bins
* Use concept maps instead of table of content
* Two speed lists:
	* Pan-subject: A list where you keep all your unprocessed thoughts
	* Subject: A list of thoughts on a specific topic

## System Overview
* Thoughts are separated into subjects
* Intra-subject
	* Thoughts on the subject
	* Maps
	* Dissertations/Points of interest
	* Abbreviations/shorthands
* Extra-subject
	* List of all subjects: The list of everything you think about
* Intelligence is having good information available at the right time at the right place

## 1 Materials
* He describes a complex system based on binders and paper sheets
* I'd rather depend on my phone and some simple note taking software for "on the go" notes, and a text editor for note management on the computer (notes are transferred from the phone to the computer)

## 2 General Principles
* Divide subjects when they become too big (up to your own decision)
* Don't spend too much time aimlessly adding content to your notebook

## 3 Intra-Subject Architecture
* There seems to be a lot of structure in place in order to save space at the cost of simplicity/ease of reading
* There are various things that cannot be done because they would require a lot of time to maintain (e.g., an index)
* He suggests to use a lot of abbreviations, but I'm against that
	* It makes it harder for newcomers to get used to the text
	* It does not really provide any direct benefit to anyone using the notes
		* I don't have space scarcity
		* I don't waste much time writing a word completely/using autocomplete
		* I want to avoid having to do any sort of lookup (or search around for what an icon means)
* There appears to be a lot of work related to maintaining content "up to date", that is, when things get deprecated, if they were referred to in many other places, those places may not get updated at that point (similar to how you might have code duplication and would not change all the other places when making a modification to one of those functions with duplicate code)

## 4 Extra-Subject Architecture
* The Grand Subject Map of Contents is a map of all of your subjects
* The Grand Subject Registry is a list of all your subjects
