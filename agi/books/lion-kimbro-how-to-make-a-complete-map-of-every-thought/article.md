* Helps with clarity of mind
* It makes it difficult to think about other positions as it helps to crystallize your thoughts

* Two types of note keeping:
	* The diary
	* The category bins
* Use concept maps instead of table of content
* Two speed lists:
	* Pan-subject: A list where you keep all your unprocessed thoughts
	* Subject: A list of thoughts on a specific topic

## System Overview

* Intra-subject
	* Thoughts on the subject
	* Maps
	* Dissertations/Points of interest
	* Abbreviations/shorthands
* Extra-subject
	* List of all subjects: The list of everything you think about
