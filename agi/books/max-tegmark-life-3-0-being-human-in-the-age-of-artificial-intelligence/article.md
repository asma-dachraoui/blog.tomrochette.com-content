### The Tale of the Omega Team
Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.
- Irving Good, 1965

### Dangerous Games
* It simply boiled down to maximizing their rate of return on investment, but normal investment strategies were a slow-motion parody of what they could do: whereas a normal investor might be pleased with a 9% return per year, their MTurk investments had yielded 9% per hour, generating eight times more money each day
* They soon realized that, even though they could get much better returns than other investors, they'd be unlikely to get returns anywhere close to what they could get from selling their own products

### New Technologies
* A good teacher can help students learn science much faster than they could have discovered it from scratch on their own

### Gaining Power
* Phase 1: Gain people's trust
* Phase 2: Persuasion
* Given any person's knowledge and abilities, Prometheus could determine the fastest way for them to learn any new subject in a manner that kept them highly engaged and motivated to continue, and produce the corresponding optimized videos, reading materials, exercises and other learning tools
* Seven slogans
	* Democracy
	* Tax cuts
	* Government social service cuts
	* Military spending cuts
	* Free trade
	* Open borders
	* Socially responsible companies
* Poll after poll showed that most voters around the world felt their quality of life improving, and that things were generally moving in a good direction. This had a simple mathematical explanation: before Prometheus, the poorest 50% of Earth's population had earned only 4% of the global income, enabling the Omega-controlled companies to win their hearts (and votes) by sharing only a modest fraction of their profits with them

## Chapter 1 - Welcome to the Most Important Conversation of Our Time
### The Three Stages of Life
* Let's define life very broadly, simply as a process that can retain its complexity and replicate
	* What's replicated isn't matter but information
* We can think of life as a self-replicating information-processing system whose information (software) determines both its behavior and the blueprints for its hardware
* The three stages of life:
	* biological evolution: evolves its hardware and software
	* cultural evolution: evolves its hardware, designs much of its software
	* technological evolution: designs its hardware and software
* The fact that most of our human software is added after birth (through learning) is useful, since our ultimate intelligence isn't limited by how much information can be transmitted to us at conception via our DNA
* The synaptic connections that link the neurons in my brain can store about a hundred thousand times more information than the DNA that I was born with
* Your synapses store all your knowledge and skills as roughly 100 terabytes' worth of information, while your DNA stores merely about a gigabyte, barely enough to store a single movie download

### Controversies
* Three distinct schools of thought
	* Digital utopians
	* Techno-skeptics
	* Members of the beneficial-AI movement
* Most controversies surrounding strong artificial intelligence (that can match humans on any cognitive task) center around two questions:
	* When (if ever) will it happen?
	* Will it be a good thing for humanity?

### Misconceptions
* The real worry isn't malevolence, but competence. A superintelligent AI is by definition very good at attaining its goals, whatever they may be, so we need to ensure that its goals are aligned with ours

## Chapter 2 - Matter Turns Intelligent
### What Is Intelligence?
* Intelligence = the ability to accomplish complex goals
* It makes no sense to quantify intelligence of humans, non-human animals or machines by a single number such as an IQ
* We can say that a third program is more intelligent than both of the others if it's at least as good as them at accomplishing all goals, and strictly better at at least one
* To classify different intelligences into a taxonomy, another crucial distinction is that between narrow and broad intelligence
* AGI: the ability to accomplish any goal at least as well as humans
* Intelligent behavior is inexorably linked to goal attainment
* The fact that low-level sensorimotor tasks seem easy despite requiring enormous computational resources is known as Moravec's paradox, and is explained by the fact that our brain makes such tasks feel easy by dedicating massive amounts of customized hardware to them - more than a quarter of our brain

### What Is Memory?
* The reason that memory is so stable is that it requires more energy than random disturbances are likely to provide to modify it
* The energy of a complicated physical system can depend on all sorts of mechanical, chemical, electrical and magnetic properties, and as long as it takes energy to change the system away from the state you want it to remember, this state will be stable
* Information can take on a life of its own, independent of its physical substrate
* Our brains store much more information than our genes: in the ballpark of 10 gigabytes electrically (specifying which of your 100 billion neurons are firing at any one time) and 100 terabytes chemically/biologically (specifying how strongly different neurons are linked by synapses)
* Whereas you retrieve memories from a computer or hard drive by specifying where it's stored, you retrieve memories from your brain by specifying something about what is stored
	* Such memory systems are called auto-associative, since they recall by association rather than by address
* It was proved that you can squeeze in as many as 138 different memories for every thousand neurons without causing major confusion

### What Is Computation?
* A computation is a transformation of one memory state into another
* How can a clump of seemingly dumb matter computer a complicated function?
	* It must exhibit complex dynamics so that its future state depends in some complicated way on the present state
	* We want the system to have the property that if we put it in a state that encodes the input information, let it evolve according to the laws of physics for some amount of time, and then interpret the resulting final state as the output information, then the output is the desired function of the input
* The fact that exactly the same computation can be performed on any universal computer means that computation is substrate-independent in the same way that information is: it can take on a life of its own, independent of its physical substrate
* Substrate independence doesn't mean that a substrate is unnecessary, but taht most of its details don't matter
* The substrate-independent phenomenon takes on a life of its own, independent of its substrate
* It's often only the substrate-independent aspect that we're interested in
