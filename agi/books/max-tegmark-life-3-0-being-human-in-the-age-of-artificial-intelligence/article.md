### The Tale of the Omega Team
Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.
- Irving Good, 1965

### Dangerous Games
* It simply boiled down to maximizing their rate of return on investment, but normal investment strategies were a slow-motion parody of what they could do: whereas a normal investor might be pleased with a 9% return per year, their MTurk investments had yielded 9% per hour, generating eight times more money each day
* They soon realized that, even though they could get much better returns than other investors, they'd be unlikely to get returns anywhere close to what they could get from selling their own products

### New Technologies
* A good teacher can help students learn science much faster than they could have discovered it from scratch on their own

### Gaining Power
* Phase 1: Gain people's trust
* Phase 2: Persuasion
* Given any person's knowledge and abilities, Prometheus could determine the fastest way for them to learn any new subject in a manner that kept them highly engaged and motivated to continue, and produce the corresponding optimized videos, reading materials, exercises and other learning tools
* Seven slogans
	* Democracy
	* Tax cuts
	* Government social service cuts
	* Military spending cuts
	* Free trade
	* Open borders
	* Socially responsible companies
* Poll after poll showed that most voters around the world felt their quality of life improving, and that things were generally moving in a good direction. This had a simple mathematical explanation: before Prometheus, the poorest 50% of Earth's population had earned only 4% of the global income, enabling the Omega-controlled companies to win their hearts (and votes) by sharing only a modest fraction of their profits with them

## Chapter 1 - Welcome to the Most Important Conversation of Our Time
### The Three Stages of Life
* Let's define life very broadly, simply as a process that can retain its complexity and replicate
	* What's replicated isn't matter but information
* We can think of life as a self-replicating information-processing system whose information (software) determines both its behavior and the blueprints for its hardware
* The three stages of life:
	* biological evolution: evolves its hardware and software
	* cultural evolution: evolves its hardware, designs much of its software
	* technological evolution: designs its hardware and software
* The fact that most of our human software is added after birth (through learning) is useful, since our ultimate intelligence isn't limited by how much information can be transmitted to us at conception via our DNA
* The synaptic connections that link the neurons in my brain can store about a hundred thousand times more information than the DNA that I was born with
* Your synapses store all your knowledge and skills as roughly 100 terabytes' worth of information, while your DNA stores merely about a gigabyte, barely enough to store a single movie download

### Controversies
* Three distinct schools of thought
	* Digital utopians
	* Techno-skeptics
	* Members of the beneficial-AI movement
* Most controversies surroundinig strong artificial intelligence (that can match humans on any cognitive task) center around two questions:
	* When (if ever) will it happen?
	* Will it be a good thing for humanity?

### Misconceptions
* The real worry isn't malevolence, but competence. A superintelligent AI is by definition very good at attaining its goals, whatever they may be, so we need to ensure that its goals are aligned with ours
