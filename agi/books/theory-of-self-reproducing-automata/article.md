# Overview
* The idea that communication between different systems is done through the translation of their respective language into the target's language (for example, from the sender's central nervous system language to the sender's language (English) to the receiver's language (English) and finally into the receiver's language central nervous system language)
	* Is the sender's CNS language different from his english language?
* The idea that digital computers are used to perform computations of exceedingly great logical depth (while it would be the opposite for natural automata) seems to imply that we should look for ANN architectures that are more parallel and less deep

# Notes
* (p14) A problem of any considerable complexity is composed of many subproblems, and flow diagrams and subroutines can be prepared for these in advance
* (p15) Thus the nervous system appears to be using a radically different system of notation from the ones we are familiar with in ordinary arithmetics and mathematics...
... whatever language the central nervous system is using, it is characterized by less logical and arithmetical depth than what we are normally used to.
Thus logics and mathematics in the central nervous system, when viewed as languages, must be structurally essentially different from those languages to which our common experience refers.
... when we talk mathematics, we may be discussing a secondary language, built on the primary language truly used by the central nervous system
* (p19) Two basic questions of automata theory:
	* How can reliable systems be constructed from unreliable components?
	* What kind of logical organization is sufficient for an automaton to be able to reproduce itself?
* (p20) Three fundamental factors limiting the engineer's ability to build really powerful computers:
	* The size of the available components
	* The reliability of these components
	* A lack of a theory of the logical organization of complicated systems of computing elements
* (p22) Natural automata are more parallel in operation, digital computers more serial
* (p22) Von Neumann calculated the thermodynamical minimum of energy that must be dissipated by a computing element and concluded that in theory computing elements could be of the order of $10^10$ times more efficient in the use of energy than neurons
* (p23) Von Neumann thought that below a certain level, complexity is degenerative, and self-reproduction is impossible. He suggested that, generally speaking, in the case of simple automata a symbolic description of the behavior of an automaton is simpler than the automaton itself, but that in the case of exceedingly complex automata the automaton is simpler than a symbolic description of its behavior
* (p24) Pulses circulating in neuron cycles, the change of neural thresholds with use, the organization of the nervous system, and the coding of the genes together constitute such a (memory) hierarchy (similar to a digital computer memory hierarchy)
