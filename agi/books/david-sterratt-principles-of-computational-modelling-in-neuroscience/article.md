# Overview

# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Introduction
### 1.1 What is this book about?
#### 1.1.1 Theories and mathematical models
* A theory is described in words, or perhaps with a diagram
* To derive predictions from the theory we can deploy verbal reasoning and further diagrams
* We are faced with the problem that there is only one theory but two possible conclusions; the theory is logically inconsistent
	* The problem has arisen for two reasons:
		* The theory was not clearly specified to start with
		* The theory is now too complex for qualitative verbal reasoning to be able to turn it into a prediction
* The solution to this problem is to specify the theory more precisely, in the language of mathematics (mathematical model)

#### 1.1.2 Why do computational modelling?
* Modelling is used as an aid to reasoning
* Modelling removes ambiguity from theories
* The models that have been developed for many neurobiological systems, particularly at the cellular level, have reached a degree of sophistication such that they are accepted as being adequate representation of the neurobiology
* Advances in computer technology mean that the number of interacting elements, such as neurons, that can be simulated is very large and representative of the system being modelled
* In principle, testing hypotheses by computational modelling could supplement experiments in some cases

## Chapter 2 - The basis of electrical activity in the neuron
* Neurons can be represented as an electrical circuit

### 2.1 The neuronal membrane
* Typically, there is greater concentration of extracellular sodium ($Na^+$) than intracellular sodium, and conversely for potassium ($K$)
* The bulk of the membrane is composed of the 5 nm thick lipid bilayer
