## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Is it possible to create some sort of hierarchy or organization of all life by looking at DNA as a form of code shared by all organisms?
* What is the smallest organism that has DNA?
	* https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/1382/which-organism-has-the-smallest-genome-length
* What comes after machines?

# Overview

# Notes
## Introduction
### Liminal Machines
* In strong theories of ALife these machines are understood not simply to simulate life but to realize it, by instantiating and actualizing its fundamental principles in another medium or material substrate
* These forms of machinic life are characterized not by an exact imitation of natural life but by complexity of behavior
* Thinking in terms of the complexity of automata, whether natural or artificial, rather than in terms of a natural biological hierarchy is part of the legacy of cybernetics
* While contemporary biologists have reached no consensus on a definition of life, there is wide agreement that two basic processes are involved: some kind of metabolism by which energy is extracted from the environment, and reproduction with a hereditary mechanism that will evolve adaptations for survival
* Theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman has suggested that thinking of the development of an organism as a program consisting of serial algorithms is limiting and that a "better image of the genetic program - as a parallel distributed regulatory network - leads to a more useful theory"
* The genetic program works by means of a parallel and highly distributed rather than serial and centrally controlled computational mechanism
	* This echoes the observation made by Christopher Langton that computation in nature is accomplished by large numbers of simple processors that are only locally connected
* A technical system forms when a technical evolution stabilizes around a point of equilibrium concretized by a particular technology

### The Computational Assemblage
* A computational assemblage comprises a material computational device set up or programmed to process information in specific ways together with a specific discourse that explains and evaluates its function, purpose, and significance
* Computational assemblages give rise to new ways of thinking about the relationship between physical processes (most importantly, life processes) and computation, or information processing
* Every isolated determinate dynamic system obeying unchanging laws will develop "organisms" that are adapted to their "environment"
* Wolfram presented a seminal demonstration of how the dynamic behavior of cellular automata falls into four distinct universality classes:
	* One that halts after a reasonable number of computations
	* one that falls into a repetitive loop or periodic cycle
	* One that generates a chaotic, random mess
	* One (the most complex) that produces persistent patterns that interact across the local spaces of the grid

### Narratives of Machinic Life
* Our human capacity as toolmakers (homo faber) has made us the vehicle and means of realization for new forms of machinic life
* This strand of thinking has given rise to two conflicting cultural narratives, the adversarial and the symbiotic
	* Adversarial: Human beings will completely lose control of the technical system, as silicon life in the form of computing machines performs what Hans Moravec calls a "genetic take-over" from carbon life
	* Symbiotic: Human beings will gradually merge with the technical system that defines and shapes the environment in a transformative symbiosis that will bring about and characterize the advent of the posthuman
* The real questions are how global properties and behaviors emerge in a system from the interactions of computational "primitives" that behave according to simple rules and how these systems are enchained in dynamic hierarchies that allow complexity to build on complexity
* One significant current in ALife research asserts that complexity (or complex adaptive systems) rather than "life" (and thus the opposition to nonlife) is the conceptually more fruitful framework

### Lamarckian Evolution or Becoming Machinic
* Lamarck's theory: acquired traits are passed down to subsequent generations through hereditary mechanisms
* Artifacts with similar purposes may be designed to very different specifications and chosen for very different reasons
* Herbert Spencer's concept of evolution: evolution is a process giving rise to increasing differentiation (specialization of functions) and integration (mutual inter-dependence and coordination of function of the structurally differentiated parts)
* Computationalism: all physical processes can be viewed or understood as computations
* One widely accepted example is the view that evolution itself is simply a vast computational process, a slow but never-ending search through a constantly changing "real" fitness landscape for better-adapted forms

## 1 Cybernetics and the New Complexity of Machines
* The living organism: a heat engine, burning glucose or glycogen or starch, fat, and proteins into carbon dioxide, water and urea
* The organism's body is very far from a conservative system, and that its component parts work in an environment where the available power is much less limited than we have taken it to be
