## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Is it possible to create some sort of hierarchy or organization of all life by looking at DNA as a form of code shared by all organisms?
* What is the smallest organism that has DNA?

# Overview

# Notes
## Introduction
### Liminal Machines
* In strong theories of ALife these machines are understood not simply to simulate life but to realize it, by instantiating and actualizing its fundamental principles in another medium or material substrate
* These forms of machinic life are characterized not by an exact imitation of natural life but by complexity of behavior
* Thinking in terms of the complexity of automata, whether natural or artificial, rather than in terms of a natural biological hierarchy is part of the legacy of cybernetics
* While contemporary biologists have reached no consensus on a definition of life, there is wide agreement that two basic processes are involved: some kind of metabolism by which energy is extracted from the environment, and reproduction with a hereditary mechanism that will evolve adaptations for survival
* Theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman has suggested that thinking of the development of an organism as a program consisting of serial algorithms is limiting and that a "better image of the genetic program - as a parallel distributed regulatory network - leads to a more useful theory"
* The genetic program works by means of a parallel and highly distributed rather than serial and centrally controlled computational mechanism
	* This echoes the observation made by Christopher Langton that computation in nature is accomplished by large numbers of simple processors that are only locally connected
* A technical system forms when a technical evolution stabilizes around a point of equilibrium concretized by a particular technology

### The Computational Assemblage
* A computational assemblage comprises a material computational device set up or programmed to process information in specific ways together with a specific discourse that explains and evaluates its function, purpose, and significance
* Computational assemblages give rise to new ways of thinking about the relationship between physical processes (most importantly, life processes) and computation, or information processing
* Every isolated determinate dynamic system obeying unchanging laws will develop "organisms" that are adapted to their "environment"
* Wolfram presented a seminal demonstration of how the dynamic behavior of cellular automata falls into four distinct universality classes
