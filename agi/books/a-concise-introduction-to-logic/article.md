# 1 Basic Concepts
## 1.1 Arguments, Premises, and Conclusions
* An argument is a group of statements, one or more of which (the premises) are claimed to provide support for, or reasons to believe, one of the others (the conclusion)
* Questions, proposals, suggestions, commands and exclamations cannot be true/false (and so are not usually classified as statements)
* The pattern found in most arguments that lack indicator words: The intended conclusion is stated first, and the remaining statements are then offered in support of this first statement

## 1.2 Recognizing Arguments
* What is needed for a passage to contain an argument:
	* At least one of the statements must claim to present evidence or reasons
	* There must be a claim that the alleged evidence supports or implies something - that is, a claim that something follows from the alleged evidence or reasons

### Simple Noninferential Passages
* Contains statements that could be premises or conclusions (or both), but what is missing is a claim that any potential premise supports a conclusion or that any potential conclusion is supported by premises
* Passages of this sort includes warnings, pieces of advice, statements of belief or opinion, loosely associated statements, and reports

### Expository Passages
* An expository passage is a kind of discourse that begins with a topic sentence followed by one or more sentences that develop the topic sentence. If the objective is not to prove the topic sentence but only to expand it or elaborate it, then there is no argument
* In deciding whether an expository passage should be interpreted as an argument, try to determine whether the purpose of the subsequent sentences in the passage is merely to develop the topic sentence or also to prove that it is true

### Illustrations
* An illustration is an expression involving one or more examples that is intended to show what something means or how it is done
* In deciding whether an illustration should be interpreted as an argument, determine whether the passage merely shows how something is done or what something means, or whether it also purports to prove something

### Explanations
* An explanation is an expression that purports to shed light on some event or phenomenon
* Every explanation is composed of two distinct components: the explanandum and the explanans
	* The explanandum is the statement that describes the event or phenomenon to be explained
	* The explanans is the statement or group of statements that purports to do the explaining
* To distinguish explanations from arguments, identify the statement that is either the explanandum or the conclusion. If this statement describes an accepted matter of fact, and if the remaining statements purport to shed light on this statement, then the passage is an explanation

### Conditional Statements
* A conditional statement is an "if ... then ..." statement
* Every conditional statement is made up of two compoenents statements:
	* The antecedent: The component statement immediately following the "if"
	* The consequent: The component statement following the "then"
* A single conditional statement is not an argument
* A conditional statement may serve as either the premise or the conclusion (or both) of an argument
* The inferential content of a conditional statement may be reexpressed to form an argument

## 1.3 Deduction and Induction
* Briefly we can say that deductive arguments are those that rest on necessary reasoning, while inductive arguments are those that rest on probabilistic reasoning
* A deductive argument is an argument incorporating the claim that it is impossible for the conclusion to be false given that the premises are true
* An inductive argument is an argument incorporating the claim that it is improbable that the conclusion be false given that the premises are true
* In deciding whether an argument is inductive or deductive, we look to certain objective features of the argument. These features include:
	* the occurence of special indicator words
	* the actual strength of the inferential link between premises and conclusion
	* the form or style of argumentation
* Inductive indicators: probably, improbable, plausible, implausible, likely, unlikely, reasonable to conclude
* Deductive indicators: necessarily, certainly, absolutely, definitely

### Deductive Argument Forms
* Argument based on mathematics
* Argument from definition
* Categorical syllogism
* Hypothetical syllogism
* Disjunctive syllogism
* A syllogism, in general, is an argument consisting of exactly two premises and one conclusion
* A categorical syllogism is a syllogism in which each statement beings with one of the words "all," "no," or "some"
* A hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism having a conditional ("if ... then ...") statement for one or both of its premises
* A disjunctive syllogism is a syllogism having a disjunctive ("either ... or ...") statement

### Inductive Argument Forms
* A prediction is an argument that proceeds from our knowledge of the past to a claim about the future
* Nearly everyone realizes that the future cannot be known with certainty; thus, whenever an argument makes a prediction about the future, one is usually justified in considering the argument inductive
* An argument from analogy is an argument that depends on the existence of an analogy, or similarity, between two things or states of affairs
* A generalization is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a selected sample to some claim about the whole group
* An argument from authority is an argument that concludes something is true because a presumed expert or witness has said that it is
* An argument based on signs is an argument that proceeds from the knowledge of a sign to a claim about the thing or situation that the sign symbolizes
* A causal inference is an argument that proceeds from knowledge of a cause to a claim about an effect, or, conversely, from knowledge of an effect to a claim about a cause
* There is a tradition extending back to the time of Aristotle that holds that inductive arguments are those that proceed from the particular to the general, while deductive arguments are those that proceed from the general to the particular
