## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Notes
## Chapter 1 - A Perspective on Testing
* Error: Mistake, bug
* Fault: result of an error
	* Fault of comission: we enter something into a representation that is incorrect
	* Fault of omission: we fail to enter correct information (missing information)
* Failure: when the code corresponding to a fault executes
* Incident: The symptoms associated with a failure occurrence
* Test: The act of exercising software with test cases
	* 2 goals:
		* find failures
		* demonstrate correct execution
* Test case: A set of inputs and expected outputs

## 1.5 Fault Taxonomies
* Input/Output Faults
* Logic Faults
* Computation Faults
* Interface Faults
* Data Faults

## 1.6 Levels of Testing
* White-box testing at the unit level
* Black-box testing at the system (integration) level

# Chapter 4 - Graph Theory for Testers
## 4.1.6 Condensation Graphs
* Given a graph G = (V, E), its condensation graph is formed by replacing each component by a condensing node
* The condensation graph of a given graph is unique

## 4.1.7 Cyclomatic Number
* The cyclomatic number of a graph G is given by V(G) = e - n + p where
	* e is the number of edges in G
	* n is the number of nodes in G
	* p is the number of components in G
