# Overview

# Notes
## Chapter 1 - Automata: The Methods and the Madness
* (p1) 1930 - Alan Turing - Turing machines
* (p1) 1940-1950 - Finite automata
* (p1) Late 1950 - Noam Chomsky - Formal grammar
* (p1) 1969 - Stephen Cook - What can and cannot be computed
* (p31) The only important constraint on what can be a language is that all alphabets are finite
* (p31) In automata theory, a problem is the question of deciding whether a given string is a member of some particular language
	Given a string $w$ in $\Sigma*$, decide whether or not $w$ is in $L$

## Chapter 2 - Finite Automata
* (p45) A deterministic finite automaton consists of:
	* A finite set of states, often denoted $Q$
	* A finite set of input symbols, often denoted $\Sigma$
	* A transition function that takes as argument a state and an input symbol and returns a state. The transition function will commonly be denoted $\delta$
	* A start state, one of the states in $Q$
	* A set of final or accepting states $F$. The set $F$ is a subset of $Q$
* (p52) The language of a DFA $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ is denoted $L(A) = \{w\ |\ \hat{\delta}(q_0, w)\mathrm{\ is\ in\ }F\}$
* (p59) The language of an NFA $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ is denoted $L(A) = \{w\ |\ \hat{\delta}(q_0, w) \cap F \not= \emptyset\}$

## Chapter 3 - Regular Expressions and Languages

## Chapter 4 - Properties of Regular Languages
* (p128) The pumping lemma: If a language is regular, then every sufficiently long string in the language has a nonempty substring that can be "pumped," that is, repeated any number of times while the resulting strings are also in the language
	* $y \not= \epsilon$
	* $|xy| \leq n$
	* For all $k \geq 0$, the string $xy^kz$ is also in $L$
* (p129) Every string longer than the number of states must cause a state to repeat
* (p139) The reversal of a string $a_1a_2...a_n$ is the string written backwards, that is, $a_na_{n-1}...a_1$. We use $w^R$ for the reversal of string $w$
* (p139) The reversal of a language $L$, written $L^R$, is the language consisting of the reversals of all its strings
* (p140) A string homomorphism is a function on strings that works by substituting a particular string for each symbol
* (p150) Fundamental questions about languages:
	* Is the language described empty?
	* Is a particular string $w$ in the described language?
	* Do two descriptions of a language actually describe the same language? (This question is often called "equivalence" of languages)
* (p151) Converting either an NFA or epsilon-NFA into a DFA can require exponential time in the number of states of the NFA, $O(n^32^n)$
	* Computing the epsilon-closure of $n$ states takes $O(n^3)$
	* The dominant cost of subset construction is, in principle, the number of states of the DFA, which can be $2^n$
		* For each state, we can compute the transitions in $O(n^3)$ time by consulting the epsilon-closure information and the NFA's transition table for each of the input symbols
* (p152) DFA-to-NFA conversion takes $O(n)$ time on an n-state DFA
* (p152) Automaton-to-Regular-Expression conversion, $O(n^34^n)$ for DFA, $O(8^n4^{2^n})$ for NFA (doubly exponential)
* (p152) Regular-Expression-to-Automaton conversion, $O(n)$ to build an epsilon-NFA, $O(n^3)$ to convert the epsilon-NFA to an ordinary NFA
* (p154) Testing if, given string w and a regular language L, w is in L
	* Takes $O(n)$ for a DFA
	* Takes $O(ns^2)$ for NFA, epsilon-NFA and regular expression $O(s)+O(ns^2)$
* (p160) $O(n^2)$ rounds to check if regular language are equivalent, $O(n^2)$ time per round to verify if one of their successor pairs has been found distinguisable, thus $O(n^4)$ to run the table-filling algorithm
	* Can be reduced to $O(n^2)$ using lists tracking which pairs depends on which pairs (and once a pair is proven distinguishable, it's simply a matter of going through that list and marking the pair as distinguishable)
* (p160) Minimization of DFA's
	* First, eliminate any state that cannot be reached from the start state
	* Then, partition the remaining states into blocks, so that all states in the same block are equivalent, and no pair of states from different blocks are equivalent
	* Use the table-filling algorithm to find all the pairs of equivalent states
	* Partition the set of states Q into blocks of mutually equivalent states
	* Construct the minimum-state equivalent DFA B by using the blocks as its state
* (p166) Operations that preserve the property of being a regular language:
	* union
	* concatenation
	* closure
	* intersection
	* complementation
	* difference
	* reversal
	* homomorphism
	* inverse homomorphism

## Chapter 5 - Context-Free Grammars and Languages
* (p173) Definition of a context-free grammar G = (V = variables, T = terminals, P = productions, S = start symbol):
	* There is a finite set of symbols that form the strings of the language being defined (called terminals or terminal symbols)
	* There is a finite set of variables, also called sometimes nonterminals or syntactic categories. Each variable represents a language
	* One of the variables represents the language being defined; it is called the start symbol. Other variables represents auxiliary classes of strings that are used to help define the language of the start symbol
	* There is a finite set of productions or rules that represent the recursive definition of a language. Each production consists of:
		* A variable that is being partially defined by the production. This variable is often called the head of the production
		* The production symbol $\rightarrow$
		* A string of zero or more terminals and variables. This string, called the body of the production, represents one way to form strings in the language of the variable of the head
* (p175) Recursive inference: Use the rules from body to head
* (p175) Derivation: Use the rules from head to body
* (p177) In order to restrict the number of choices we have in deriving a string, it is often useful to require that at each step we replace the leftmost variable by one of its production bodies. Such a derivation is called a leftmost derivation, and we indicate that a derivation is leftmost by using the relations $\xRightarrow[lm]{}$ and $\xRightarrow[lm]{*}$
* (p177) Similarly, it is possible to require that at each step the rightmost variable is replaced by one of its bodies. If so, we call the derivation rightmost and use the symbols $\xRightarrow[rm]{}$ and $\xRightarrow[rm]{*}$
* (p183) The parse trees for G = (V, T, P, S) are trees with the following conditions:
	* Each interior node is labeled by a variable in V
	* Each leaf is labeled by either a variable, a terminal, or $\epsilon$. However, if the leaf is labeled $\epsilon$, then it must be the only child of its parent
	* If an interior node is labeled A, and its children are labeled $X_1, X_2, ..., X_k$ respectively, from the left, then $A \rightarrow X_1X_2...X_k$ is a production in P.
* (p185) The concatenation of the leaves of any parse tree, taken from them left, is called the yield of the tree
* (p208) A CFG G = (V, T, P, S) is ambiguous if there is at least one string w in T* for which we can find two different parse trees, each with root labeled S and yield w. If each string has at most one parse tree in the grammar, then the grammar is unambiguous
* (p209) There is no algorithm that can tell us whether a CFG is ambiguous
* (p210) A factor is an expression that cannot be broken apart by any adjacent operator

## Chapter 6 - Pushdown Automata
* (p225) The pushdown automaton is essentially an epsilon-NFA with the addition of a stack
* (p225) We define two different versions of the pushdown automaton:
	* One that accepts by entering an accepting state
	* One that accepts by emptying its stack, regardless of the state it is in
* (p230) Instantaneous description of a PDA (q, w, $\gamma$)
	* q is the state
	* w is the remaining input
	* $\gamma$ is the stack contents

## Chapter 8 - Introduction to Turing Machines
* (p316) Proving formally that there is no program to do a stated task is quite tricky
* (p318) We know there are infinitely fewer programs than there are problems
* (p318) If a problem as an algorithm that always tells correctly whether an instance of the problem has answer "yes" or "no," then the problem is said to be "decidable". Otherwise, the problem is "undecidable"
* (p321) Suppose that we know problem $P_1$ is undecidable, and $P_2$ is a new problem that we would like to prove is undecidable as well
* (p322) In order to make a proof that problem $P_2$ is undecidable, we have to invent a construction that converts instances of $P_1$ to instances of $P_2$ that have the same answer
* (p322) Any string in the language $P_1$ is converted to some string in the language $P_2$, and any string over the alphabet of $P_1$ that is not in the language of $P_1$ is converted to a string that is not in the language $P_2$
* (p322) Once we have this construction, we can solve $P_1$ as follows:
	* Given an instance of $P_1$, that is, given a string $w$ that may or may not be in the language $P_1$, apply the construction algorithm to produce a string $x$
	* Test whether $x$ is in $P_2$, and give the same answer about $w$ and $P_1$
* (p325) Using the Turing machine notation, we shall prove undecidable certain problems that appear unrelated to programming
* (Formal description of a Turing machine skipped)
* (p334) There is another notion of "acceptance" that is commonly used for Turing machines: acceptance by halting. We say that a TM halts if it enters a state q, scanning a tape symbol X, and there is no move in this situation; i.e., $\delta(q, X)$ is undefined
	* We assume that a TM always halts when it is in an accepting state
* (p341) As with programs in general, it helps to think of Turing machines as built from a collection of interacting components, or "subroutines"
