## Introduction
* One of the critical differences between you and a machine is that a machine is never required to function until after it is built
* Every animal has to function even as it builds itself

### The Questions of Developmental Biology
* There are two fundamental questions in developmental biology:
	* How does the fertilized egg give rise to the adult body?
	* How does that adult body produce yet another body?
* Seven general categories of questions scrutinized by developmental biologists:
	* Differentiation: How can an identical set of genetic instructions produce different types of cells?
	* Morphogenesis: How can the cells in our body organize themselves into functional structures?
	* Growth: How do our cells know when to stop dividing? How is cell division so tightly regulated?
	* Reproduction: How are these germ cells (sperm and egg) set apart from the cells that are constructing the physical structures of the embryo, and what are the instructions in the nucleus and cytoplasm that allow them to form the next generation?
	* Regeneration: How do the stem cells retain their capacity (to form new structures even in adults), and can we harness it to cure debilitating diseases?
	* Evolution: How do changes in development create new body forms? Which heritable changes are possible, given the constraints imposed by the necessity that the organism survive as it develops?
	* Environmental integration: How is the development of an organism integrated into the larger context of its habitat?

## Chapter 1 - Developmental Anatomy
* Multicellular organisms do not spring forth fully formed. Rather, they arise by a relatively slow process of progressive change that we can development
* In nearly all cases, the development of a multicellular organism begins with a single cell - the fertilized egg, or zygote, which divides mitotically to produce all the cells of the body

### The Cycle of Life
* The stages of development between fertilization and hatching are collectively called embryogenesis
* Six fundamental processes
	* Fertilization: Fusion of the mature sex cells, the sperm and the egg, which are collectively called the gametes. The fusion of the gamete nuclei gives the embryo its genome, the collection of genes that helps instruct the embryo to develop in a manner very similar to that of its parents
	* Cleavage: A series of extremely rapid mitotic divisions that immediately follow fertilization
	* Gastrulation: After the rate of mitotic slows down, the blastomeres underogo dramatic movements and change their positions relative to one another. As a result of gastrulation, the embryo contains three germ layers that will interact to generate the organs of the body
	* Organogenesis: The cells interact with one another and rearrange themselves to produce tissues and organs
	* Metamorphosis: To become a sexually mature adult
	* Gametogenesis: The development of gametes
* The gametes and their precursor cells are collectively called germ cells (the formation of a new generation)
* All other cells of the body are called somatic cells (the individual body)
