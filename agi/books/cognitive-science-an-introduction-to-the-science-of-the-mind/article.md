# Overview

# Notes
* (p21) The human perceptual systems are information channels with built-in limits of about 7 items, or around 3 bits
* (p21) Chunking can be used to work around this limitation
* (p21) Natural language is the ultimate chunking tool
* (p22) The phenomenon of selective attention occurs in every sense modality
* (p22) Broadbent intepreted the dichotic listening experiments as showing that we can only attend to a single information channel at a time (assuming that each ear is a separate channel) - and that the selection between information channels is based purely on physical characteristics of the signal
* (p24) Information is everywhere, but in order to use it organisms need to represent it
* (p25) (the idea that) Information processing is done by dedicated and specialized systems
* (p29) Cognition can be understood as information processing and information processing can be understood as an algorithmic process
* (p29) One can try to understand how particular cognitive systems work by breaking down the cognitive tasks that they perform into more specific and determinate tasks
* (p34) SHRDLU consists of twelve different systems. Winograd himself divides these into three groups. Each group carries out a specific job
	* Syntactic analysis
	* Semantic analysis
	* Integrating the information acquired with the information the system already possesses
