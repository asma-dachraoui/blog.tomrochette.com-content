## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

Marvin Minsky's *The Society of Mind* is the epitome of connectionism[^connectionism].

# Thoughts

## Unsorted

* Tasks are executed by low-level, specialized cognitive functions
* The brain is organized hierarchically, where more abstract processes are at the top and low-level functions are at the bottom. In between are *functionalities* that become more and more complex and abstract as they go to the top of the hierarchy
* Higher level functions manage low level functions to ensure they are doing their work properly as well as going in the right direction (doing the *right* thing)
* Higher level functions are competing with one another for resources and being the *main* active process
* Hierarchy of processes
* How are computers different from us?
* They follow instructions
* They don't start things by themselves (do we start things ourselves or if that simply the result of interacting with others?)
* Subconscious -> competing processes that are running in the background

## 7.6 Reinforcement and Reward
* Reward the few moments before success. Works only for short solutions.
* What happens in an architecture with minimal memory? What happens when we gradually increase that memory?
* Only able to execute parts of a big loop
* Procedures encoded as part of a speciesâ€™ genes

## 7.7 Local Responsibility
* Global vs local reward policy/scheme
* Global reward leads to slower learning

## 7.10 Genius
* Genius: knows how to manage what he learns
* Learn to rearrange how to think
* Learn better ways to learn to learn

## 8.1 K-lines: A Theory of Memory
* Tag all the tools that helped you solve a problem
* How do you know which tools to use? Won't you end up taking too many tools? Is it then a question of removing tags from tools that did not contribute to the solution?
* Tags = fragments of ideas

# Notes

## 7.3 The Puzzle Principle
**Puzzle Principle:** We can program a computer to solve anyt problem by trial and error, without knowing how to solve it in advance, provided only that we have a way to recognize the problem is solved.

## 7.4 Problem Solving

**The Progress Principle:** Any process of exhaustive search can be greatly reduced if we prossess some way to detect when "progress" has been made. Then we can trace a path toward a solution, just as a person can climb an unfamiliar hill in the dark - by feeling around, at every step, to find the direction of steepest ascent.

**Goals and Subgoals.** The most powerful way we know for discoverying how to solve a hard problem is to find a method that splits it into several simpler ones, each of which can be solved separately.

**Using Knowledge.** The most efficient way to solve a problem is to already know how to solve it. Then one can avoid search entirely.

## 8.1 K-lines: A Theory of Memory
How is knowledge represented?
How is it stored?
How is it retrieved?
Then, how is it used?
