# Overview

Marvin Minsky's *The Society of Mind* is the epitome of connectionism[^connectionism].

## Ideas

* Tasks are executed by low-level, specialized cognitive functions
* The brain is organized hierarchically, where more abstract processes are at the top and low-level functions are at the bottom. In between are *functionalities* that become more and more complex and abstract as they go to the top of the hierarchy
* Higher level functions manage low level functions to ensure they are doing their work properly as well as going in the right direction (doing the *right* thing)
* Higher level functions are competing with one another for resources and being the *main* active process
