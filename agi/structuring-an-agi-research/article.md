## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

The most general questions every AGI researcher needs to answer include[^1]:
* What is AGI, accurately specified?
* Is it possible to build the AGI as specified?
* If AGI is possible, what is the most plausible way to achieve it?
* Even if we know how to achieve AGI, should we really do it?

A complete AGI work normally includes[^1]:
* a theory of intelligence,
* a formal model of the theory,
* a computational implementation of the model.

Define the problems and questions you are trying to solve.

* This is what I am solving
* This is what I am building
* This is how I am solving it
* Here is how we can think about it now

---

* State the problem you want to solve in general terms
* Collect previous work related to your research
* Understand the material
* Implement the ideas found in previous work
* Specify your problem in details
* Think (and use PÃ³lya How to Solve It)
* Implement your idea and compare it/Review
* Report/Publish
* Discuss topic with colleagues
