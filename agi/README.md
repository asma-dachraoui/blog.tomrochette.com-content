# Artificial General Intelligence

The articles contained within this repositories are mostly works in progress. I try to explore various topics that interest me and think through them at various points in time.

I try to explore the following topics:

* AGI
* AI
* Intelligence
* Cognition
* Reality
* Humans as machines
* Computer architecture
* Chatbots
* Natural language processing
* and many more topics.

Feel free to leave me comments, questions and feedback through github issues!
