## Context

It is interesting to ponder on how we, as human, have arised from non-living matter such as organic compounds. One of the reasons it is of interest is that it may teach us lessons that may apply to how intelligence arised from non-intelligent being or how something of one type can transform into something of another type.

## Learned in this study

* Intelligence as a tree of life

# Overview

What is the probability of a simple cell, evolving by undirected natural processes? $1$ in $10^{64}$[^1],

The probability of life, a simple cell, evolving by undirected natural process is $1$ in $10^{340,000,000}$, which is known as operationally impossible[^1] [^2].

Abiogenesis assumes that meaningful prescriptive information can be created from a purely physical mechanism, which completely violates the laws of information[^1] [^2].
