## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

## Overview

Due to current hardware limitations, it is currently important to separate data storage into two categories:

* **Short term / volatile storage** which concerns itself with speed and efficiency of data retrieval.
* **Long term / persistent storage** which concerns itself with compression and conversion to short term / volatile storage.

## Short term / Volatile storage (STS)

## Long term / Persistent storage (LTS)
