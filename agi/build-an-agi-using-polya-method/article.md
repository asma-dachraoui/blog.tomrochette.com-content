## Context

Polya's How to Solve It[^1] is considered by many a reference on how to teach mathematical problem resolution to students. It is however also an interesting and invaluable tool that can be used to solve any problem in general. In this study, we attempt to apply his method to the problem "Build an AGI".

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

# Understand the problem

## Do you understand all the words used in starting the problem?
* Build: use tools and materials in order to construct something
* AGI: artificial general intelligence
	* Artificial: As opposed to natural, that came from nature
	* General: as opposed to specific or specialized, capable of being/doing many things
	* Intelligence:
		* the ability to accomplish goals in a given environment
		* the ability of an agent to adapt itself to an environment in order to accomplish goals
		* the ability of things to make use of energy in a constructive manner (build upon the past)
		* the ability to model the environment in order to devise effective plans to accomplish objectives
		* the ability to extract patterns in the environment and make effective use of them in an internal model of this environment
		* the ability for an agent to expand his ideology in other agents
		* the ability of an agent to make the most out of as little energy as possible
		* the ability to predict the future ands make the most efficient user if that knowledge
		* the ability to make use of experience and context in a novel situation
		* the ability to build models and use these models
		* the ability to build Turing machines and simulate these machines (mentally)
		* the ability to be self-directed
		* the ability to accomplish things (the more things you can accomplish, the more intelligent you are)
		* the ability to process inputs into meaningful outputs (the more varied the inputs you can process, the more intelligent you are)
		* the ability to resolve problems
		* the ability to make efficient use of a limited amount of resources(energy/time) toward objectives

## What are you asked to find out show?
* That AGI is possible
* One or many methods through which it would/is be possible to accomplish/reach AGI
* A path toward the development of AGI
* The requirements of AGI
* A/The definition of AGI

## Can you restate the problem in your own words?
* Identify the components necessary to the construction of an AGI
* Determine how to assemble these components
* Assemble the components

## Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the problem?
* Environment/body separation
* Environment/cell separation
* Input/process/output diagram

## Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?
No, maybe, we know that biology is able to produce natural general intelligence through humans, assuming that everything that goes inside the brain can be liken to signals transmission and processing, it should be possible run a  brain in vat that is considered intelligent.
