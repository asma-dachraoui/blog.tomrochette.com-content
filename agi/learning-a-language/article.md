## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Adapt vocabulary learning based on word frequency of learner
* Why is it that it appears easier to learn to speak first than it is to learn to read first?
* What makes it easy to add new knowledge to existing one? Is learning random words an appropriate approach, or is there some constructive method, such as learning pronouns, then learning sentence structure, then a few critical verbs, and so on?
* Is it possible to learn a language without linking utterances to things or existing internal concepts?
* What are the stages of language learning as an adult and is there some duration between stages as in children development?

## 5 principles of rapid language acquisition
* Focus on language content that is relevant to you
	* Attention, meaning, relevance and memory
	* We master tools by using tools, we learn tools faster when they are relevant
* Use your new language as a tool to communicate from day 1
* When you first understand the message you will unconsciously acquire the language (comprehensive input)
	* Language learning is not about knowledge
* Physiological training
	* When your face hurts, you are doing it right
* Psychophysiological state matters

## 7 actions for rapid language acquisition
* Listen a lot (brain soaking)
* Focus on getting the meaning first (before the words)
* Start mixing (create sentences from the words you know)
