# Overview

The goal of this study is to learn how we, as humans, are nothing more than machines ourselves. I will approach this by comparing ourselves with a computer, which is one of the most advanced machine we've developed as a specie so far. Both the hardware and software will be analyzed in order to make parallels between us and machines.

# The components

## Storage medium

## Input

### Keyboard

### Mice

## Output
