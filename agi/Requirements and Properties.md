# Requirements and Properties

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

# Overview

* Computation/Processing
* Memory
	* Storage
		* Compression
	* Retrieval

# Things it should do

* Improve algorithms
	* Learn which data structure is the most appropriate for a problem
		* Inspect code and be able to figure out if the current data structure is the best one for its current use
* Improve data structures

# Important properties

* Signal filtering (ignore non-essential data to reduce the domain size)
* Abstraction/simplification/class generation. Learn to group similar stimuli so that you do not have to learn about each of them individually.
* It should be constructive: modifying or adding new features should not require that its database be flushed/reset.
