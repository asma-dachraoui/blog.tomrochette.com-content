# Overview

<pre>
<tomzx> well, my understanding of turing so far is that you can represent pretty much anything as a number
<tomzx> except those non-computable numbers
<tomzx> so every word can be represented as a number, phrase (order of words) as a number, documents as a number, thoughts as a number, etc.
<tomzx> basically everything can be labelled
<tomzx> then you can "easily" say A <-> B
<tomzx> in the sense that the entity represented by A is related to the entity represented by B
<tomzx> although I don't think that gets us very far
