## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Is the whole neural architecture designed such that types (input/output formats) are already defined by the time we are born? In other words, the neural architecture is static and definitive (e.g. it has X, Y, Z layers of type A, B, C to process vision)
* How is it decided which neuron will take responsibility for recalling something? Is there any mechanism that prevents the neuron's "memory" from being replaced by something else?

# Overview

## What we think we know
* Many billions of neurons
* Small integrative unit that can represent any function
* Synchronous activation increases the propensity of neurons to fire again together
* 6 layers of different neurons types within the cortex
* Numerous Brodmann regions with apparently some specialized functions
* The capability for the brain to adapt from certain parts being damaged or removed
* Some damage cannot be recovered
* Some of the brain architecture is incomplete at birth and will complete during the early years of development (which may last up to 10 years for humans)
* The selectivity of overdeveloped neurites is converted into a choice in the same way observing an electron collapses the wave function
