## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

* Unsupervised classification learning (learning without others giving us feedback or without reward feedback loops)
* Importance of training from simple to complex problems?
* By learning enough examples, the brain is able to reconfigure itself in order to be more efficient and by the same means generalizes certain concepts, thus increasing its understanding
* Hierarchy of abilities (sounds, words, sentences, ideas)

# Overview

Learning is lossy encoding (similar to lossy compression).
