## Context

Games are complex, self-contained environment from which an AGI can learn. Games most often have a user interface and a set of rules, which are generally easily understood by their players. However, is it possible for simple vision algorithms (and maybe more) to understand and extract the mechanics of a game?

I'd like to explore 5 types of games:
* Real Time Strategy (Starcraft 2)
* First Person Shooter (Counter-Strike, Halo, Battlefield, CoD)
* Simulation/Sandbox (Minecraft, Sims)
* (MMO)RPG (WoW, Dark Souls)
* MOBA (LoL, Dota 2)
