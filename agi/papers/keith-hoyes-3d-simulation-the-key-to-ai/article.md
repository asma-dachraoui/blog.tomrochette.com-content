# Overview

## 1 Introduction
* If a concept cannot be described in three dimensions over time, it is quite likely false

## 2 Pillars of Intelligence
* The three pillars of intelligence
	* Virtual time travel
	* Virtual reality
	* Information bridge to reality

## 3 Consciousness
* Your basic human being is constructed from a virtual reality chamber connected to a biological, self assembling, nanotech robot with sensors
* The chamber is self learning from exposure to the outside world and free will stems from a process of grading simulated predictions against pre-programmed genetic and culturally programmed schemas

## 3.1 Feeling and Qualia
* When energy and matter are able to represent coherent information, such information can subsequently be graded, and that information interpreted as feeling
* Evolution uses the process of consciousness and the subjective "closed loop" belief in feelings, to guide behavior toward the survival and reproduction of genes
* Although we may assert pleasure and pain to be computational illusions, we have no conscious control of the process; so telling ourselves pain is just information will not work
* What we actually perceive are virtual objects within our own minds, the senses are used to align these objects to external reality, to consolidate existing memories, or to train new memories if the objects are novel
* This is the point at which subconscious can take hold, by taking these behavior precent options and running trials "subconsciously," away from the preceived scene - which may be linked or not to reality through the sensorimotor system
* Just as the eyes are formed in expectation of light, so the brain is formed with memory references in expectation of information against which to compare

## 4 General Intelligence
* (Intelligence) When bound to the real world, it is the ability to so deeply understand the nature of reality, of which it can provide increasingly accurate predictive power
* For intelligence to exist at all, there are certain environmental pre-cursors:
	* A physical medium upon which it can bind the predictions: reality
	* A representative medium in which it can model the predictions: virtual
	* A motive force: energy
* For intelligence to speculate on our reality it needs a means to:
	* Access that reality: exposure
	* Perceive that reality: modalities
	* Decipher that reality: instantiation machinery
	* Model that reality: modeling machinery
	* Grade the simulations: emotional machinery
	* Classify and store data: memory machinery
* It is presumed that computers are deterministic and humans non deterministic
* For all intents and purposes both can be considered non deterministic, though statistically predictable

## 4.1 Human Intelligence
* The human mind is a particularly difficult thing to understand, but it is the best example we have of intelligence with intentionality
* The brain appears to achieve this through a massive structure of neural networks which are able, over time, to effectively interpret sensory data in order to understand and predict the perceived environment - more usually our external world
* There are two priorities to human cognition
	* Reactive thought, which involves negotiating real world environments, objects and people in real time
	* Reflective thought, which involves thinking by processing memory records, with limited or no external sensory perception, but with far greater depth and precision
* The process of human learning is thus predicated on exposure to the real world through the sense modalities
