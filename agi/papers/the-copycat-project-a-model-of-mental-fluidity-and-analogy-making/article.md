## Copycat and mental fluidity

### Analogy Problems in the Copycat Domain
* Copycat's architecture is neither symbolic nor connectionist
* Copycat architecture is an emergent architecture, in the sense that its top-level behavior emerges as a statistical consequence of myriad small computational actions, and the concepts that it uses in creating analogies can be considered to be a realization of "statistically emergent active symbols"

### The intended universality of Copycat's microdomain
* This project, which sprang out of two predecessors, Seek-Whence and Jumbo, has been under development since 1983
* The Copycat project is not about simulating analogy-making per se, but about simulating the very crux of human cognition: fluid concepts
* The reason the project focuses upon analogy-making is that anology-mkaing is perhaps the quintessential mental activity where fluidity of concepts is called for, and the reason the project restricts its modeling of analogy-making to a specific and very small domain is that doing so allows the general issues to be brought out in a very clear way

### A perception-based, emergent architecture for mental fluidity
* One of the main ideas of the project is that even the most abstracted and sophisticated mental acts deeply resemble perception
* The inspiration for the architecture comes in part from a computer model of low-level and high-level auditory perception: the Hearsay II speech-understanding project

## The Three Major Components of the Copycat Architecture
* The Slipnet: the site of all permanent Platonic concepts. It can be though of, roughly, as Copycat's long-term memory
* The Workspace: the locus of perceptual activity. It contains instances of various concepts from the Slipnet, combined into temporary perceptual structures. It can be though of, roughly, as Copycat's short-term memory or working memory, and resembles the global "blackboard" data-structure of Hearsay II
* The Coderack: can be thought of as a "stochastic waiting room", in which small agents that wish to carry out tasks in the Workspace wait to be called

## The Slipnet - Copycat's network of Platonic concepts
* A network of interrelated concepts, each concept being represented by a node, and each conceptual relationship by a link having a numerical length, representing the "conceptual distance" between the two nodes involved
* There are roughly 60 concepts in Copycat's Slipnet
* Conceptual links in the Slipnet adjust their lenghts dynamically
* Conceptual distances gradually change under the influence of the evolving perception (or conception) of the situation at hand

### Conceptual depth
* Each node in the Slipnet has one very important static feature called its conceptual depth
* This is a number intended to capture the generality and abstractness of the concept
* Assignment of conceptual depths amount to an a priori ranking of "best-bet" concepts
