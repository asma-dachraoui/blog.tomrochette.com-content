# Alan Turing - Intelligent Machinery (1948)

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

* Verify that my definitions of discrete/continuous and controlling/active are correspond with the examples given by Turing

# Overview

Turing starts his paper by presenting five *reasons* as to why people have a hard time accepting that machinery could show intelligent behavior.

1. Unwillingness to accept that something could rival human intelligence
2. Building such a machine would be going against God (or playing God)
3. The inability to see past the initial capability of machines
4. GÃ¶del incompleteness theorem pointing at the fact that some query may end up with the machine unable to ever answer
5. The intelligence displayed by the machine is nothing more than the intelligence of its creator

After touching on the validity of some of those reasons, Turing presents two categories of machinery:
 * Discrete vs continuous
 * Controlling vs active

## Discrete vs continuous

A *discrete* machine has a finite number of possible states. Thus, the machine jumps from one state to the other.

A *continuous* machine on the other hand is more fluid, not being in any particular/exact state at any moment.

## Controlling vs active

A *controlling* machine is one that deals only with information. It computes/decides/communicates with the rest of the environment but does not do any physical action itself.

An *active* machine produces a definite physical effect.
