## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* An ultraintelligent machine can rely on other machines, like humans relies on machines to do things (as well as other human beings)

# Overview

# Notes
## 1. Introduction
* A detailed knowledge of semantics might not be required, since the artificial neural network will largely take care of it, provided that the parameters are correctly chosen, and provided that the network is adequately integrated with its sensorium and motorium (input and output). For, if these conditions are met, the machine will be able to learn from experience, by means of positive and negative reinforcement, and the instruction of the machine will resemble that of a child

## 2. Ultraintelligent Machines and Their Value
* Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever
* Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an "intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far behind
* Thus, the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control
* It is true that it would be uneconomical to build a machine capable only of ordinary intellectual attainments, but it seems fairly probable that if this could be done then, at double the cost, the machine could exhibit ultraintelligence
* There are ethical problems, such as whether a machine could feel pain especially if it contains chemical artificial neurons, and whether an ultraintelligent machine should be dismantled when it becomes obsolete
* Until an ultraintelligent machine is built perhaps the best intellectual feats will be performed by men and machines in very close, sometimes called "symbiotic," relationship
* In order to achieve the requisite degree of ultraparallel working it might be useful for many of the elements of the machine to contain a very short-range microminiature radio transmitter and receiver
* There is a great waste in having only a small proportion of the components of a machine active at any one time
* Whether a machine of classical or ultraparallel design is to be the first ultraintelligent machine, it will need to be able to handle or to learn to handle ordinary language with great facility. This will be important in order that its instructor should be able to teach it rapidly, and so that later the machine will be able to teach the instructor rapidly
* A man cannot learn more than ten million statements in a lifetime *(source?)*
	* A machine could already store this amount of information without much difficulty, even if it were not ultraparallel, but it seems likely that it would need to be ultraparallel in order to be able to retrieve the information with facility
	* It is in recall rather than in retention that the ordinary human memory reveals its near magic
* For men, meaning serves a function of economy in long-term retention and in information handling
	* This is the basis for our contention that semantics are relevant to the design of an ultraintelligent machine
* In communication, a process of "generalized regeneration" always occur, and that it serves a function of economy 

## 3. Communication as Regeneration
* The advantage of remembering the word rather than the precise sound is that there is then less to remember and a smaller amount of information handling to do
* This process of regeneration occurs to some extent at each of the levels of phonemes, words, sentences, and longer linguistic stretches, and even at the semantic level, and wherever it occurs it serves a function of economy

## 4. Some Representations of "Meaning" and Their Relevance to Intelligent Machines
* When we ask for the meaning of a statement we are talking about language, and are using a metalanguage; and when we ask for the meaning of "meaning" we are using a metametalanguage
* For human beings, meaning is concerned with the outside world or with an imaginary world, so that representations of meaning that are not entirely linguistic in content might be more useful for our purpose
* The behaviorist regards a statement as a stimulus, and interprets its meaning in terms of the class of its effects (responses) in overt behavior
* We call an object a cow if it has enough of the properties of a cow, with perhaps no single property being essential
* An object is said to belong to class $C$ if some function $f(p_1, p_2, ..., p_m)$ is positive, where the $p$'s are the credibilities (logical probabilities) that the object has qualities $Q_1, Q_2, ..., Q_m$

## 5. Recall and Information Retrieval
* The usual method for attacking the problem of document retrieval, when there are many documents (say several thousand), is to index each document by means of several index terms
* The process can be made more useful, not allowing for the work in its implementation, if the terms of the documents, and also those of the customer, are given various weights, serving in some degree the function of probabilities. We then have a weighted or statistical system of information retrieval
* When we wish to recall a memory, such as a person's name, we consciously or unconsciously use clues, analogous to index terms
* The speed of neural conduction is much too slow for a primarily serial search to be made

## 6. Cell Assemblies and Subassemblies
* A cell assembly is assumed to consist of a great number of neurons, which can all be active at least once within the same interval of about a quarter to half a second
* An assembly reverberates approximately as a unit, and, while reverberating, it tends to inhibit the remainder of the cortex, not neuron by neuron, but enough so that no other assembly can be very active during the same time interval
* It will be assumed that there are also subassemblies that can be active without dominating the whole cortex, and also that when an assembly becomes fatigued and breaks up it leaves several of its own subassemblies active for various lengths of time, from a second to several minutes, and typically about ten seconds
* Each subassembly would consist of a smaller group of neurons than an assembly, but with greater relative interconnectivity
