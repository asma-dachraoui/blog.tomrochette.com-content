## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* RSI Convergence Theory

# Overview

# Notes
* Need a definition of improvement
	* Solving the same problem faster or with less need for computational resources
	* Improvement in error rates or finding closer approximations to optimal solutions
* The major improvement we want from self-improving intelligent software is higher degree of intelligence which can be approximated via machine friendly IQ tests with a significant G-factor correlation
* Three levels of improvement
	* Modification
	* Improvement (weak self-improvement)
	* Recursive improvement (strong self-improvement)
* In the field of complex dynamic systems, also known as chaos theory, positive feedback systems are well known to always end up in what is known as an attractor - a region within the system's state space that the system can't escape from (similar to the idea that trying to compress a compressed file multiple times will not lead to any compression at some point)
* Yudkowsky terminology
	* Cascades: When one development leads to another
	* Cycles: Repeatable cascade in which one optimization leads to another which in turn benefits the original optimization
	* Insight: New information which greatly increases one's optimization ability
	* Optimization slope: The goodness and number of opportunities in the space of solutions
	* Optimization resources: How much computational resources an agent has access to
	* Optimization efficiency: How efficiently the agent utilizes these computational resources
* The bootstrap fallacy: The notion of an unbounded self-improvement machine is a fallacy
* Two approaches to improvements discovery:
	* Brute force based approach using Levin (Universal) Search
	* The system has a certain level of scientific competence and uses it to engineer and test its own replacement
* A hybrid RSI system which includes both an artificially intelligent program and a human scientist
* We can also evaluate systems as to certain binary properties. FOr example: We may be interested in only systems which are guaranteed not to decrease in intelligence, even temporarily, during the improvement process
* We're interested in understanding the necessity of unchanging source code segments, that is, if there are certain parts of the source code of the system that needs to remain unchanged from generation to generation
* We're interested in understanding if the RSI process can take place in an isolated system or if interacting with the external environment is necessary
