## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* Intelligence is humans increases over time by the fact we can teach, and thus have young humans know earlier than we did. Does it mean that we will be limited by how fast teaching can happen?
* It might be impossible to detect superintelligence on others planets due to the fact that increased intelligence => compressed information => indistinguishable from random noise
	* On the other hand, compressed information can be decompressed, thus it might be possible to attempt to decompress noise streams

# Overview

# Notes
## 1 Introduction
* There are many different potential paths toward a singularity:
	* Mind uploading
	* Knowledge-based reasoning and planning software
	* Artificial agents that learn from experience
	* Self-evolving intelligent systems
	* Awakening of the Internet
* Chalmers cleverly circumvents a proper discussion or definition of intelligence by arguing
	* there is something like intelligence
	* there are many cognitive capacities correlated with intelligence
	* these capacities might explode
	* intelligence might amplify or explode

## 2 Will there be a Singularity
* Different estimates on the computational capacity of a human brain consistently point towards $10^{15}$...$10^{16}$ flops/s
* If computational speeds double every two years, what happens when computer-based AIs are doing the research?
	* Computing speed doubles every two years
	* Computing speed doubles every two years of work
	* Computing speed doubles every two subjective years of work
	* Two years after Artificial Intelligence reach human equivalence, their speed doubles. One year later, their speed doubles again. Six months, 3 months, 1.5 months ... Singularity.

## 3 The Singularity from the Outside
* Insiders will produce improved computers ad infinitum at an accelerated pace
* Insiders may attempt to communicate with outsiders at the maximal digestible rate
* After a brief period, intelligent interaction between insiders and outsiders becomes impossible. The inside process may from the outside resemble a black hole watched from a safe distance
* Outward explosion is likely to end or convert the outsiders' existence
* People now more and more explore virtual worlds rather than new real worlds
	* Virtual worlds can be designed as one sees fit and hence are arguably more interesting
	* Outward expansion now means deep sea or space, which is an expensive endeavor
* Expansion usually follows the way of least resistance
* Inward explosion will stop when computronium is reached. Outward explosion will stop when all accessible convertible matter has been used up
