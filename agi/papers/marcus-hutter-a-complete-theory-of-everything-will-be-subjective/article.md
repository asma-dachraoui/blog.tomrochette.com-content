# Overview

# Notes
## 1 Introduction
* Theory is meant as "any model which can explain/describe/predict/compress our observations, whatever the form of the model"
* One can show that the more one can compress, the better one can predict, and vice versa
* ToE: Theory of Everything
* CToE: Complete Theory of Everything, includes observer localization
* It will be shown that the observer is indispensable for finding or developing any (useful) ToE

## 4 Completes ToEs (CToEs)
* A ToE by definition is a perfect model of the universe. It should allow to predict all phenomena. Most ToEs require a specification of some initial conditions, e.g. the state at the big bang, and how the state evolves in time (the equations of motion)
* A complete ToE needs specification of
	* (i) initial conditions
	* (e) state evolution
	* (l) localization of observer
	* (n) random noise
	* (o) perception ability of observer
* Among two CToEs, select the one that has shorter overall length
	* Length(i) + Length(e) + Length(l)
