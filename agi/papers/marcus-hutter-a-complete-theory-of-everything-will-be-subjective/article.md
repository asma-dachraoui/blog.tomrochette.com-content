## 1 Introduction
* Theory is meant as "any model which can explain/describe/predict/compress our observations, whatever the form of the model"
* One can show that the more one can compress, the better one can predict, and vice versa
* ToE: Theory of Everything
* CToE: Complete Theory of Everything, includes observer localization
* It will be shown that the observer is indispensable for finding or developing any (useful) ToE

## 4 Completes ToEs (CToEs)
* A ToE by definition is a perfect model of the universe. It should allow to predict all phenomena. Most ToEs require a specification of some initial conditions, e.g. the state at the big bang, and how the state evolves in time (the equations of motion)
* A complete ToE needs specification of
	* (i) initial conditions
	* (e) state evolution
	* (l) localization of observer
	* (n) random noise
	* (o) perception ability of observer
* Among two CToEs, select the one that has shorter overall length
	* Length(i) + Length(e) + Length(l)

## 5 Complete ToE - Formalization
* Universal Turing Machine (UTM)
* $UTM(q) = u^q_1u^q_2u^q_3... =: u^q_{1:\infty}$
* $u^q_{1:\infty}$ is the (fictitious) binary data file of a high-resolution 3D movie of the whole universe from the big bang to big crunch, augmented by $u^q_{N+1:\infty} \equiv 0$ if the universe is finite
* A camera records part of the universe u denoted by $o = o_{1:\infty}$
* The only philosophical pressuposition made is that it is possible to determine uncontroversially whether two finite binary strings (on paper or file) are the same or differ in some bits
* $UTM(q, u^q_{1:\infty}) = o^{sq}_{q:\infty}$
	* $u^q_{1:\infty}$ an infinite input stream
	* $o^{sq}_{q:\infty}$ the sequence observed by subject $s$ in universe $u^q_{1:\infty}$ generated by $q$
* Program $s$ contains all information about the location and orientation and perception abilities of the observer/camera, hence specifies not only item (l) but also item (o) of Section 4
* $o^{true}_{1:t}$ the past observations of some concrete observer in our universe (e.g. your own personal experience of the world from birth till today)
* $o^{true}_{t+1:\infty}$ are unknown
* The observation sequence $o^{sq}_{q:\infty}$ generated by a correct CToE must be consistent with the true observation $o^{true}_{1:t}$
* If $o^{sq}_{q:\infty}$ would differ from $o^{true}_{1:t}$ (in a single bit) the subject would have "experimental" evidence that (q, s) is not a perfect CToE
* Among a given set of perfect $(o^{sq}_{q:\infty} = o^{true}_{1:t})$ CToE $\{(q, s)\}$, select the one of smallest length Length(q) + Length(s)

## 6 Universal ToE - Formalization
* The universal ToE generates all computable universes. The generated multiverse can be depicted as an infinite matrix in which each row corresponds to one universe (and the column represent the observation at time t)
* The standard way to linearize an infinite matrix is to dovetail in diagonal serpentines through the matrix

$$\breve{u}_{1:\infty} :=
u^\epsilon_1
u^0_1
u^\epsilon_2
u^\epsilon_3
u^0_2
u^1_1
u^{00}_1
u^1_2
u^0_3
u^\epsilon_4
u^\epsilon_5
u^0_4
u^1_3
u^{00}_2
...$$
