## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* How is "experience" stored and retrieved in a non-expensive manner?
	* Lossy compression?
* Store unique/vivid characteristics
	* How does one determine what constitutes a unique characteristic?
* It is often suggested that strong emotions facilitate remembering, why is that?
* What is the impact of having access to the Internet on our need to memorize things such as laws or formulas?

# Overview

# Types of memory
* Implicit
	* Procedural
* Explicit/Declarative
	* Episodic
	* Semantic
	* Autobiographical
	* Spatial
	* Recognition

# Brain structures
* Hippocampus
	* Mediates the recording of episodic memories
	* Identifies common features between episodes
	* Links these common episodes in a memory space
* Prefrontal cortex
	* Remembering contextual details of an experience
* Amygdala
	* Encoding and retrieval of emotionally charged memories

# Memory experiments
* How can I access a given memory?
* How many numbers can I remember?
* How many letters can I remember?
* How many words can I remember?
* How many people can I remember?
* How many concepts can I remember?

# Unsorted
* We have the ability to access our memory at will
* The memory seems to be accessible in many ways and indexed through different means
* Maybe it is available in a graph form such that thinking in time period uses a region where indexing is done in that manner
* Some memories may be directly accessed if we aren't querying something of particular interest
* However, if we want to remember something more specifically, then we may enter a form of filtering where we query by asking for appropriate indexes
	 * e.g., what was I doing in 2007 at school?
