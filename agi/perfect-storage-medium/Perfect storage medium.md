## Context

The perfect storage medium is an important aspect of building an agent capable of storing and retrieving information as fast as possible. Thus, it is critical to define what would be the optimal ways to fetch and put data into storage as well as the current state of the art in that matter.

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore

- How to store an immense volume of data
	- While taking less space
	- While being easily to work with
	- While being as fast as possible
	- While still potentially allowing operations such as lookup or search

# Overview

## Properties
