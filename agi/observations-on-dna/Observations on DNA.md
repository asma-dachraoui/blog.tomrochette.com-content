# Overview

DNA is the software of life. If that is true, who wrote the code?
One may extrapolate that the bigbang is similar to the generation of random code and that everything that follows is simply random permutation/mutation of the randomness that ended up into something that is coherent. Like a well programmed neural network, with enough time, randomness will start to generate patterns.

DNA: Transfer/evolution of genetic software

We are an gigantic assembly of billions of cell-sized machines. Each and every cell contains its own copy of the program (DNA) which is itself about 3 billion nucleotides. As there are 4 valid nucleotides/bases, (2^2)^(3*10^9) possible combinations.
