## Context

## Learned in this study

## Things to explore
* DNA is the software of life. If that is true, who wrote the code?
* How does the reproduction of cells (of an embryo) works in term of computation?
* If DNA is considered as the storage/tape of a Turing machine, can be it considered to be expandable? What are the other similar properties of DNA and Turing machines?
* Isomorphism between DNA and programs

# Overview
One may extrapolate that the bigbang is similar to the generation of random code and that everything that followed it is simply random permutation/mutation of the randomness that ended up into something that is coherent. Like a well programmed neural network, with enough time, randomness will have at some point to generate patterns. However we know from the study of blind (as opposed to guided) program generation, such as through a linear method, that the space of programs strings (chain of character that may or may not produce an executable program) is immense in comparison of the space of valid programs. It can easily be compared to the problem of finding a needle in a haystack. In a similar way, given hundred of thousands of valid programs, if we want to find a particular one that does X specific things, then we're making it harder for a search/filtering algorithm to return us an appropriate one.

We are an gigantic assembly of billions of cell-sized machines. Each and every cell contains its own copy of the program (DNA) executed by each and everyone of these machines and which is itself about 3 billion nucleotides. As there are 4 valid nucleotides/bases, there are $(2^2)^{(3 \times 10^9)}$ possible combinations/programs. However, considering that we (humans) all share a ton of similar attributes (we all have two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs and so on), it makes sense to assume that a lot of our DNA code is shared with one another.

In the body, or more specifically in each cell, the DNA is used as the source from which ARNm is transcribed and then translated into a protein.

Our genetic software (DNA) itself only changes/evolve through the combination of two parent chromosomes.

Some properties:
* Code rarely changes (only when a new "program"/human is created)
* New code is the combination of two existing codes
* Two code bases are relatively similar (99.5% similar[^1])
* A large amount of DNA is shared with other animals[^2], which could imply that we either developed shared code base (evolved from similar ancestors) or that we ended up developing similar code bases independently
* The 5' and 3' section of the mARN could be compared to the preambule and epilogue of functions in assembly, they serve to indicate the beginning and ends of block of information/instructions
* If DNA is a string, then it most likely has a grammar (and its own language)
* Must follow some syntactic rules or else it is incorrect (see protein folding)
* Evolution is nature's nondeterministic way to test out DNA machines, some survive, others don't
